## Objectives
- Retrieve the flag from the DNS server!

## Dig Digging

Instructions on THM:

Oooh, turns out, this 10.10.15.233 machine is also a DNS server! If we could dig into it, I am sure we could find some interesting records! But... it seems weird, this only responds to a special type of request for a givemetheflag.com domain?

Solution:

So I run a dig command against the IP address and specify givemetheflag.com as a parameter:

`dig @10.10.15.233 givemetheflag.com`

```
; <<>> DiG 9.18.4-2-Debian <<>> @10.10.15.233 givemetheflag.com
; (1 server found)
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 2982
;; flags: qr aa; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

;; QUESTION SECTION:

;; ANSWER SECTION:
givemetheflag.com.      0       IN      TXT     "flag{<REDACTED>}"
