## Objectives
- User flag
- Root flag

## Initial Enumeration

### Nmap Scan

`sudo nmap -sC -sV -p- -oN nmap --min-rate=4500 active.htb`

## SMB Digging

The first thing I take a look at is SMB since there are no web ports open. I use smbmap and it viewing shares with a null session is successful.

`smbmap -H active.htb`

![](images/active1.png)

Connecting over to the Replication share and downloading the files gives us several to look at.

`smbclient -N //active.htb/Replication/`

![](images/active2.png)

Using `tree` to clean up the view of files.

![](images/active3.png)

I recursively grep for the term password in all files that were downloaded and find that in the Groups.xml file we have an old cpassword hash for the active.htb\SVC_TGS user.

`grep -r "password" .`

![](images/active4.png)

The cpassword hashes are very old hashes that were used with group policy in versions of Windows before 2012. They are also instantly reverseable with a build in tool called gpp-decrypt.

`gpp-decrypt "edBSHOwhZLTjt/QS9FeIcJ83mjWA98gw9guKOhJOdcqh+ZGMeXOsQbCpZ3xUjTLfCuNH8pG5aSVYdYw/NglVmQ"`

![](images/active5.png)

That gives us credentials for the SVC_TGS user. Let's see where we can use those.

Using crackmapexec shows that we have read access to additional shares now.

![](images/active6.png)

Looking through the NETLOGON share shows that it's empty. The SYSVOL share is a copy of the Replicaiton share and has the same files in it. And the Users share appears to be the c:/users folder on the machine since you can go to the SVC_TGS desktop and find the user.txt flag.

I also ran crackmapexec to find a list of users on the system.

`crackmapexec smb active.htb -u 'SVC_TGS' -p '<REDACTED>' --users`

![](images/active7.png)

I add those users to a file called users.txt and then check to see if any users are vulnerable to ASREPRoast, and none are.

`impacket-GetNPUsers active.htb/ -dc-ip active.htb -usersfile users.txt -format hashcat -outputfile asrep.hash`

![](images/active8.png)

Checking for users vulnerable to Kerberoasting shows that the Administrator user has a SPN set and is vulnerable, and we're able to capture their hash.

![](images/active9.png)

Checking the hashcat mode shows us it's mode 13100 for cracking.

![](images/active10.png)

The password cracks quickly using hashcat.

`hashcat -m 13100 kerb.hash ~/rockyou.txt`

## System Access

Now that we have credentials for the Administrator account I look at what ports are available that allow remote access and don't see anything that jumps out other than WinRM which doesn't work when I try.

I give impacket-smbexec a try and it works for me.

`impacket-smbexec active.htb/Administrator@active.htb`

You can find the user.txt and root.txt flags at the following locations.

With that we've completed this CTF!

## Conclusion

A quick run down of what we covered in this CTF:

- Basic enumeration with **nmap** and **gobuster**
- Using **smbmap** to find an open share on SMB that allows null sessions
- Downloading all files from the SMB share and finding **Groups.xml** which has a usernamd and password hash in it
- Using the **gpp-decrypt** tool on the cpassword hash to recover the password of the SVC_TGS account
- Using **crackmapexec** to find a list of users on the system
- Finding that the Administrator account is vulnerable to **kerberoasting** using **impacket-GetUserSPNs**
- Cracking the Administrator password with **hashcat**
- Using **impacket-smbexec** to obtain a shell on the system as Administrator
