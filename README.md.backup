### Hello World
##### January 31st 2022

Hello everyone who may have stumbled across this site and thank you for visiting. I'm creating primarily as a place to post walkthroughs for CTF challenges I complete as a way to:

- Reinforce my learning
- Get in the habit of documenting everything
- And give back the community / help those who are learning as well

I'll try and publish new walkthroughs at least once a week but will often add more than that.

I originally started creating the walkthroughs on a default GitHub repository and after the first 5 or 6 decided that creating a Jekyll style page would be much better suited for something like this.

If you have questions, comments, or would like to set something like this up yourself and need a little help there please feel free to get in touch.

Again, thanks for visiting and I hope you find this resource useful.
