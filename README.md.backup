## Today is the day my Evolve Security bootcamp starts!
#### January 31st 2022



About 3 months ago I finished some local college courses in their Cybersecurity learning path, and it turned out that the next step in the path wasn't available in the spring semester and I'd have to wait many months until the summer semester to be able to continue on. That was too long to wait so I decided to look around for other learning opportunities.

There were several choices but I eventually ended up seriously looking at the bootcamp that **Evolve Security** offered. It had great reviews, they seemed to be well respected in the industry, and many other features such as help with job placement, a voucher for the Security+ certification at the end of the bootcamp, and other bonuses.

It was a definitely a bit pricey, but in the end I believed it would be well worth the cost given everything I found during my research. So I took the plunge and officially signed up.

Today, it finally starts! It's going to be a lot of work with classes meeting 4 days a week and every other Saturday, which equates to roughly 20-30 hours of work per week split between in class work, out of class studying, and hands on labs.

I'm excited and can't wait to get started!

## *Hello World*
#### January 31st 2022

Hello everyone who may have stumbled across this site and thank you for visiting. I'm creating this primarily as a place to post walkthroughs for CTF challenges I complete as a way to:

- Reinforce my learning
- Get in the habit of documenting everything
- And give back the community / help those who are learning as well

I'll try and publish new walkthroughs at least once a week but will often add more than that.

I'm currently learning with the eventual goal of career switching into Cybersecurity so I'll also sometimes add accomplishments or other Cybersecurity related items to this blog as well.

If you have questions, comments, or would like to set something like this up yourself and need a little help there please feel free to get in touch.

Again, thanks for visiting and I hope you find this resource useful!
