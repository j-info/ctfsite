#### April 20th 2022

Topics: ![](images/linux.png) ![](images/smb.png) ![](images/web.png) ![](images/subrion.png) ![](images/cve.png)

This is a brand new box that just came out and it let's us interact with the **Subrion** CMS system to find it's weaknesses.

Since I ran out of still active easy boxes on HTB I decided to give my first medium rated HTB machine a try. After a lot of enumeration, use of multiple CVE's, and some modification of config files and environmental variables I was successful! This was a fun one to go through.

No walkthrough yet since this is still an active box.

And now I know why I haven't done a lot of Windows boxes on TryHackMe...I'm already running out of ones to choose from. If there are more they're likely hidden in the hard and above rating which I'll have to check out.

This ended up being a very quick and easy refresher on basic linux commands.

## SANS OSINT Summit 2022
#### April 7th 2022

Topics: ![](images/learning.png)

I attended the all day OSINT summit hosted by SANS today and it was such a fun and great day of learning. You can see from the list of topics and speakers that there were a wide variety of OSINT areas covered, as well as some truly exceptional speakers.

At the end of her talk [**Alethe Denis**](https://twitter.com/AletheDenis) had a mini OSINT challenge that she gave to everyone attending where you had to search out her previous jobs and private message her the 2nd job she ever had, as well as where it was located.

**I was the first person to complete the challenge!**

Unexpected given I'm still a beginner with OSINT and the conference had veteran industry pros attending. So either they weren't competing, or I got lucky, but either way it was a lot of fun!

Thanks to **SANS** for hosting this wonderful event and I look forward to next years!

I've done quite a few Linux based boxes and am starting to feel more and more comfortable in that realm, but haven't done nearly as many Windows boxes. Because of that I'm going to start getting out of my comfort zone and working on Windows boxes to increase my skills there.

## Antisyphon - Intro to Social Engineering
#### March 29th 2022

Topics: ![](images/learning.png)

I completed my first Antisyphon class today and it was very well done. I can see why their classes have been so highly praised and recommended!

Ed Miro ([**@c1ph0r on Twitter**](https://twitter.com/c1ph0r)) taught us the basics about social engineering in a fun and engaging way and covered the following topics:

- Common attack vectors
- Good foundational books to get started with
- Influence
- Nonverbal communication
- Effective pretexting
- Sock puppets
- Red flags to look out for if you think somebody is trying to target you

He also did live demos for:

- SEToolkit
- Metasploit
- GoPhish

This one took awhile to finish with 2 lateral movements, both an internal and external webpage, and other things to trip you up along the way such as restricted shells. I had a great time going through it though!

This was also the last easy rated active machine on HTB that I needed to finish, so they're all complete for now until the next one is released.

No walkthrough since this box isn't officially retired yet.

This was an interesting box with several vulnerabilities that required a bit more enumeration than other boxes I've done up to this point. Especially the part where you had to figure out what was running on port 1337. I definitely enjoyed this one!

This was pretty challenging for an easy rated box and it took awhile and a lot of google searching to figure out how to do some things that were new to me like using curl to interact with an API, forge JWT tokens, create and interact with core dumps to pull information out of memory, and more.

Again, no walkthrough since this box is not officially retired.

## *Paper* on Hack the Box
#### February 7th 2022

Topics: ![](images/linux.png) ![](images/web.png) ![](images/wordpress.png) ![](images/lfi.png)

This is my first actual HTB machine other than the starting point so it was a lot of fun comparing how things are on HTB vs how they are on THM. HTB definitely holds your hand less so the difficulty I'd say is a bit higher than comparably rated machines on THM.

I also went through this with somebody from my **Evolve** bootcamp and when you see the term **I** you can take it as **we** since we both spent several hours in Discord banging our heads against a wall figuring out each piece of the puzzle. Despite that we loved every second of it!

I won't post the actual walkthrough yet since this box is only 2 days old and it's against the HTB terms of service, but here's a completion screenshot:

## Week 1 of the Evolve Bootcamp Complete
#### February 4th 2022

Topics: ![](images/learning.png)

I couldn't be happier with how well the first week went. The lead instructor, Michael Creaney, is not only extremely knowledgeable but is good at teaching as well. Sometimes you get one or the other, but not this time thankfully.

The assistant instructors are also very good and seem like they truly care. They're all Evolve alumni so they've been through the bootcamp and can help out with any general questions we have in addition to providing insight on what we're learning.

So far so good!

## Today is the day my Evolve Security Bootcamp Starts!
#### January 31st 2022

Topics: ![](images/learning.png)

About 3 months ago I finished some local college courses in their Cybersecurity learning path, and it turned out that the next step in the path wasn't available in the spring semester and I'd have to wait many months until the summer semester to be able to continue on. That was too long to wait so I decided to look around for other learning opportunities.

There were several choices but I eventually ended up seriously looking at the bootcamp that **Evolve Security** offered. It had great reviews, they seemed to be well respected in the industry, and many other features such as help with job placement, a voucher for the Security+ certification at the end of the bootcamp, and other bonuses.

It was a definitely a bit pricey, but in the end I believed it would be well worth the cost given everything I found during my research. So I took the plunge and officially signed up.

Today, it finally starts! It's going to be a lot of work with classes meeting 4 days a week and every other Saturday, which equates to roughly 20-30 hours of work per week split between in class work, out of class studying, and hands on labs.

I'm excited and can't wait to get started!

## *Hello World*
#### January 31st 2022

Hello everyone who may have stumbled across this site and thank you for visiting. I'm creating this primarily as a place to post walkthroughs for CTF challenges I complete as a way to:

- Reinforce my learning
- Get in the habit of documenting everything
- And give back the community / help those who are learning as well

I'll try and publish new walkthroughs at least once a week but will often add more than that.

I'm currently learning with the eventual goal of career switching into Cybersecurity so I'll also sometimes add accomplishments or other Cybersecurity related items to this blog as well.

If you have questions, comments, or would like to set something like this up yourself and need a little help there please feel free to get in touch with me on Twitter - [**@jdotinfo**]

Again, thanks for visiting and I hope you find this resource useful!
