## *Brute It* on TryHackMe

Topics: ![](images/linux.png) ![](images/web.png) ![](images/brute.png) ![](images/hydra.png) ![](images/cracking.png) ![](images/jtr.png) ![](images/hashcat.png)

All the brute forcing in this one. Good practice if you're looking to brush up on tools such as hydra, John the Ripper, and hashcat.

This one was a little frustrating. Not because of the challenge, but because of how slow the machine was that you had to use for the challenge.

## *One Year!*
#### January 31st 2023

Topics: ![](images/learning.png)

Today marks two milestones. The first is that one year ago today I created my first post and put this blog online! I've had a lot of fun keeping this blog going and don't see myself stopping it anytime soon.

The second milestone, also one year ago today, is that I started the Evolve Academy cybersecurity bootcamp. That was the beginning of me going all in with cybersecurity and thankfully with a lot of hard work and effort it paid off and I now have a job in the industry.

Thanks to those of you who are readers of this blog and I hope you all find it useful and manage to learn something from it!

I really liked this CTF because it had you using services like Redis, NFS, and rsync which aren't seen in many CTF's. It also required you to set up an SSH tunnel to access services on their internal network.

## *eJPT v2 Certification*
#### January 22nd 2023

Topics: ![](images/learning.png)

Even though I just finished the training materials a couple days ago I decided to take the certification exam over the weekend...and passed! The exam was fair in that if you went through the training you have everything you need to pass the exam without studying elsewhere which was good to see. I don't think their detection system is 100% though. It docked me a question on transferring files to and from a system even though I did this on multiple hosts with multiple tools and methods. So it would be nice if they told you what they were looking for regarding how that should be done exactly. Either way, I'm glad I took the time to go for this cert since the training was very well done.

Now on to working towards the OSCP!

I had a lot of fun going through this years Advent of Cyber challenges over at TryHackMe [**and even won one of the daily prizes believe it or not**](https://mobile.twitter.com/RealTryHackMe/status/1602352579404603393), so that was cool. I ended up giving the voucher away to a student I was teaching in the bootcamp who had started using THM and liked it.

![](images-other/thm-prize.jpg)

I'd have to say my favorite challenges this year were the game hacking and the MQTT web cam challenge with the video flag at the end. Thanks to THM for putting on another great year of challenges!

## *eJPT v2 Studying*
#### December 11th 2022

Topics: ![](images/learning.png)

I haven't updated on the eJPTv2 studying lately because I had to put that on hold for a bit. But, I'm back at it, and just finished the **34 hour Metasploit training module**. That's not a typo it actually was 34 hours. I knew a good portion of the things covered here but I definitely learned quite a few things as well. This puts me at 62% complete on the training for eJPTv2, so I'm getting there, just a bit slower than I had hoped.

My nights are going to be opening up again since the cybersecurity bootcamp I'm a teaching assistant at is winding down with less than a week left. Once that happens it's full steam ahead on this certification now that it's finally officially released!

The website has a vulnerable tomcat version running that allows us to use the Ghostcat exploit to view sensitive files on the system and obtain login credentials. From there we find an encrypted message, and after decrypting it with GPG it contains additional login credentials allowing us to laterally move to another user. That user can run zip as root and we escalate over to root with it.

We find a public facing MySQL database with a username, and password hash, which we crack and gain access to the website. From the admin panel we can upload a .php reverse shell to get our initial foothold on the system.

This was a long one. We start off on a webserver and find an LFI vulnerability, then use that LFI issue with Burp to fuzz files on the system and recover a private SSH key for an initial foothold. Then we break out of a program we had sudo access to and laterally move to another user. Finally we have write permissions on a bash script that root executes via crontab and reverse shell back to us with it.

Continuing on to the next CTF in the DC series we tackle DC-2 this time. This CTF has us enumerate a WordPress site, build a custom wordlist, and hydra our way into it. Ultimately we're able to just ssh in with the website credentials and find ourselves in a very restricted shell which we break out of, laterally move to another user, and then escalate to root.

## *DEF CON!*

Topics: ![](images/learning.png)

I had such a good time at DEF CON meeting up with my new co-workers at Evolve Security as well as people from the bootcamp I went through, it was great to meet everyone in person.

The conference itself was something to experience for sure. So many smart and interesting people to meet, hang out with, and learn from. The talks were very well done and the hands on activities were also great. They had a really cool badge this year too which was a musical keyboard with challenges to complete on it.

Some of the things I went and saw / did:

- Practical Dark Web Hunting using Automated Scripts
- Intro to Lockpicking
- Vulnerability Assessment of a Satellite Simulator
- The Big Rick: How I Rickrolled my High School District and Got Away With It
- Tor: Darknet Opsec By a Veteran Darknet Vendor & the Hackers Mentality
- Offensive Wireless Security 101
- Hands on lockpicking and tamper proof hacking
- Wandering around to all of the villages and meeting people

Outside of that I went and saw the OmegaMart exhibit which was really fun and attended several of the DEF CON parties.

If you haven't been I highly recommend it!

With the Security+ certification down my next goal is to move towards the eJPT v2 certification. It's currently in a transitional phase moving from a multiple choice exam (v1) to a practical exam (v2), but the course materials are already out there for v2 since it will be going live in the not too distant future.

I signed up for the INE service earlier this week and have been going through the course. In total there are 144 hours of training across 4 sections, so it's quite extensive and so far I have to say it's very well done. It's in a video lecture and then practice what you learned in a lab format which I really like.

I just completed section 1 which was 24 hours of training and covered the following with subsections under each:

A new room that was just released a few days ago. This was an SQL injection heavy CTF which was used along with hashcat to establish an initial foothold. After that we find a non-standard SUID file which allows us to laterally move to another user. We then find a backdoor installed on the system and are able to escalate to root through it. Had a good time going through this one!

#### July 19th 2022

Topics: ![](images/linux.png) ![](images/web.png) ![](images/burp.png) ![](images/mongodb.png) ![](images/ldpreload.png)

This was a fun CTF that saw us exploiting a password reset mechanism to gain admin access on the website and then using that to get an initial foothold on the system. From there we found some credentials in a Mongo database and were able to laterally move to another user. Finally that user had sudo access to run a backup utility along with LD_PRELOAD being set allowing us to create a malicious .c script, compile it, and use it to escalate to root while calling the backup utility.

## General Update
#### July 18th 2022

Topics: ![](images/learning.png)

These past 3 weeks have been pretty crazy leaving me no time to update this blog. The Security+ exam I was supposed to take on June 29th had to be rescheduled due to technical issues at the testing center and was moved to July 12th. I passed on my first try!

[**View Certificate**](https://www.credly.com/badges/37096bdd-da9f-4655-93f8-b8f9d2f54bd2)

The intensive 5 month Evolve Security Academy bootcamp I was in came to a close and we had 2 weeks to complete the multi-part finals, which are now done. Just before the finals our capstone project was a real world vulnerability assessment on a company Evolve Security lined up and the students were responsible for finding vulnerabilities, creating a deliverable report for the customer, and presenting the findings to the customer over Zoom. I was one of the 4 presenters selected to go over findings with the customer.

And as a huge bonus I was offered a job as a Teachers Assistant in the next bootcamp starting at the end of July. I've accepted and will be joining the Evolve Security Academy team as a result.

[**View Certificate**](https://www.credly.com/badges/85e94015-66b4-4eb9-8ff7-f92d9e12d6df)

And on top of that I've been spending a lot of time searching for a full time position in cybersecurity. I've had some good leads and interviews but haven't found the right fit yet.

Now that things have calmed down a bit it's back to your regularly scheduled programming and you should be seeing some new CTF walkthroughs posted here soon. I've missed doing these and am excited to get back to it.

## Antisyphon - Intelligence Investigations: Business
#### June 21st and 22nd 2022

Topics: ![](images/learning.png)

This was a 2 day course taught by Joe Gray that focused on advanced OSINT topics. Some of the topics covered were:
- Deep dive into DNS for use in investigations
- Public filings: where you can find them and what you can learn from them
- Using social media sites to gather information for use in social engineering campaigns
- Building technology maps, associated vendors, and more from job postings

It rounded out with a CTF that required the use of techniques learned throughout the course to find required information which was a lot of fun. Thanks to Antisyphon for yet another great pay what you can course!

## SANS Ransomware Summit 2022
#### June 16th and 17th 2022

Topics: ![](images/learning.png)

This summit was 14 hours split over 2 days and had some very interesting and useful information covering a wide range of ransomware topics. Some of the presentations I found the most interesting were:

+ How to engage with an attacker after you've fallen victim to an attack
+ Cryptocurrency and it's role in organized cybercrime
+ The cybercriminal supply chain and how it's different pieces are getting more and more specialized, and how they're starting to function more like legit businesses would
+ And an incident response retelling from a targetted ransomware attack in the industrial sector

This is the 3rd summit I've attended from SANS and they're always such great events.

#### June 12th 2022

Topics: ![](images/linux.png) ![](images/web.png) ![](images/ftp.png) ![](images/jtr.png) ![](images/sudo.png)

A quick finish on this one. We find password protected .zip files on an FTP server that we can login to anonymously. We download the .zip files, crack the passwords, and unzip them to find they contain id_rsa files. We use one of those to ssh into the system and find clear text credentials inside of a .mysql_history file, and use credentials to check sudo -l which shows us we can run anything as root.

This box has several websites to investigate and we eventually find one we're able to login as admin to and use a php reverse shell to gain our initial foothold. After that we find user credentials in a file and use those to laterally move. The user we move to has sudo privileges for both pkexec and time, and we can use either to escalate to root.

## Security+ Certification
#### June 6th 2022

Topics: ![](images/learning.png)

The Evolve bootcamp I've been in since January will be ending in a little over 2 weeks so I'm preparing for the final project and test there, as well as spending a lot of time studying for the Security+ certification.

The bootcamp includes an exam voucher for the Security+ and I decided to take a work backwards approach and schedule a date to sit for the exam. I've always liked this approach since it let's you avoid the trap of drawing the process out longer than it needs to be and forces you to really focus on the objective.

So with that said I'll be taking the exam on June 29th, and because of that you'll see less CTF walkthroughs here than normal since I'm focusing on finishing the bootcamp and studying for the Security+.

A lot of website enumeration was required on this CTF since there were 3 different websites and rabbit holes to dig into. We eventually find an upload form that allows us to send a php reverse shell and establish our initial foothold on the system. After that we find cap_setuid+ep set on python2.7 and use it to escalate to root.

This system we find a username in the web pages source code, a password in robots.txt, and then ssh over for our initial foothold. Then we see the system was running a very old version of Ubuntu that's vulnerable to the **CVE-2015-1328** aka **overlayfs** exploit which we use to escalate our privileges to root.

## SANS Emergency Webcast - MSDT "Follina" (CVE-2022-30190)
#### May 31st 2022

Topics: ![](images/cve.png)

I attended this emergency webcast today where Jake Williams from the SANS Institute covered Follina (CVE-2022-30190) and ways to detect, mitigate, and hunt for it.

This exploit abuses the ms-mdt protocol handler and there are already several POC published. In addition it's pretty trivial to exploit.

### A couple ways to mitigate:
- Disable the MSDT protocol:
> [**Microsoft MSRC Blog**](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2022/05/30/guidance-for-cve-2022-30190-microsoft-support-diagnostic-tool-vulnerability/)
- Disable troubleshooting tools via GPO:
> reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\ScriptedDiagnostics" /t REG_DWORD /v EnableDiagnostics /d 0

<br>

### A few ways to detect:
- Check for msdt.exe running, this is the one thing that will always be a constant in this exploit
- sdiagnhost.exe will be the parent process
- Check to see if winword.exe connects to websites other than *.microsoft.com or *.office.com
 
<br>

### Forensics and hunting:
- Check the Microsoft Office internet cache:
> reg query "hkcu\software\microsoft\office\16.0\common\internet\server cache"
- Yara rule by Joe Security:
> [**joesecurity.org Yara Rule**](https://joesecurity.org/resources/follina.yara)
- Sigma rules by Chris Peacock or Kostas:
> [**Chris Peacock GitHub**](https://github.com/securepeacock/sigma/blob/963289fbbc961454979d3b0219ac103a4142e1b4/rules/windows/process_creation/proc_creation_win_msdt_follina.yml) or

## Antisyphon: Active Defense & Cyber Deception
#### May 26th 2022

Topics: ![](images/learning.png)

This was a 4 day class taught by former SANS instructor John Strand. A few of the topics covered were:
+ Various open source tools that can be easily configured and setup in your environment to detect, delay, and gather information on attackers
+ The legality of active defense: what to avoid and what is ok based on actual legal precedence
+ The MITRE Engage framework
+ Canarytokens, port spoofing, honeypots, honeyports, and other honey measures
+ 9 different hands on labs
+ And much more

This course really drove home how you can use active defense and cyber deception not just for malicious "hackback" type activies, but also for attribution, detection capabilities, and slowing attackers down giving you more time to respond. I had a great time taking this training and look forward to additional Antisyphon classes soon!

Topics: ![](images/linux.png) ![](images/ftp.png) ![](images/jtr.png) ![](images/cracking.png) ![](images/gpg.png) ![](images/hashcat.png)

This was also a pretty quick CTF. We only had 2 ports open: FTP and SSH, and when connecting to the FTP server and logging in as anonymous we find the entire file system available to us. We find a private PGP key and encrypted backup file and then crack the password on the PGP key and use it to decrypt the backup which gives us a copy of the /etc/shadow file. We then crack the root hash and login to the system.

This was a long box but I learned a lot and it was well done and fun to go through. We initially found files on a public NFS share that we deduced usernames from, and then used crackmapexec to find the hash of a user which we cracked and began to enumerate SMB with. 3 lateral movements later we finally land on a user who has the backup operators group and are able to exploit robocopy to escalate our privileges to system.

There was a lot going on with this box from cracking, to decoding, and even steganography. We used a webshell embedded into the website for initial access and then found credentials for a SQL database, which led us to additional credentials we could use to ssh in. After that we were able to laterally move to a user who was a member of the docker group which allowed us to mount an image as root to find our final flag.

I've been working my way through this learning path and completed it today. It consists of 32 hours of training and covers the following:
- Using Burp suite intruder, repeater, encoder/decoder, comparer, sequencer, BApp store, and more
- Went through the OWASP top 10 and also had you go complete the OWASP Juice Shop challenges
- Covered many standard vulnerability types such as IDOR, LFI, RFI, SSRF, XSS, RCE, SQLi, and more

That's 5 of the 7 learning paths complete now, and the last two I'm over 50% of the way through already. Almost there!

I finally did it! Level 13 is the highest level you can achieve on TryHackMe and I got there today. Out of 1.1 million users on the site I'm currently ranked number 4683. Given the relatively short amount of time I've been using the site I hope that reflects the amount of time and effort I've been putting into furthering my learning.

I found and started using TryHackMe a little over 5 months ago right in the middle of their annual Advent of Cyber 3 Christmas event and have been loving it ever since. I've learned so much since then and will continue to do so on a daily basis until I get to where I want to be in cybersecurity.

I attended the all day OSINT summit hosted by SANS today and it was such a fun and great day of learning. You can see from the list of topics and speakers that there were a wide variety of OSINT areas covered, as well as some truly exceptional speakers.

At the end of her talk [**Alethe Denis**](https://twitter.com/AletheDenis) had a mini OSINT challenge that she gave to everyone attending where you had to search out her previous jobs and private message her the 2nd job she ever had, as well as where it was located.

**I was the first person to complete the challenge!**

Unexpected given I'm still a beginner with OSINT and the conference had veteran industry pros attending. So either they weren't competing, or I got lucky, but either way it was a lot of fun!

Thanks to **SANS** for hosting this wonderful event and I look forward to next years!

Topics: ![](images/windows.png) ![](images/web.png) ![](images/oscommerce.png) ![](images/sshtunnel.png) ![](images/mimikatz.png)

In this CTF we get to poke around osCommerce to obtain a shell, and then use mimikatz to pull credentials out of memory.

I've done quite a few Linux based boxes and am starting to feel more and more comfortable in that realm, but haven't done nearly as many Windows boxes. Because of that I'm going to start getting out of my comfort zone and working on Windows boxes to increase my skills there.

## Antisyphon - Intro to Social Engineering
#### March 29th 2022

Topics: ![](images/learning.png)

I completed my first Antisyphon class today and it was very well done. I can see why their classes have been so highly praised and recommended!

Ed Miro ([**@c1ph0r on Twitter**](https://twitter.com/c1ph0r)) taught us the basics about social engineering in a fun and engaging way and covered the following topics:

- Common attack vectors
- Good foundational books to get started with
- Influence
- Nonverbal communication
- Effective pretexting
- Sock puppets
- Red flags to look out for if you think somebody is trying to target you

He also did live demos for:

- SEToolkit
- Metasploit
- GoPhish

This one took awhile to finish with 2 lateral movements, both an internal and external webpage, and other things to trip you up along the way such as restricted shells. I had a great time going through it though!

This was also the last easy rated active machine on HTB that I needed to finish, so they're all complete for now until the next one is released.

This was an interesting box with several vulnerabilities that required a bit more enumeration than other boxes I've done up to this point. Especially the part where you had to figure out what was running on port 1337. I definitely enjoyed this one!

## 90 Day Badge on TryHackMe!

Back in December I set a goal to take learning much more seriously, and today I hit a milestone. 90 days in a row of learning something new without missing a single day on TryHackMe! Make learning a daily habit.

This was a pretty frustrating box because of the Android emulation. I ran into problem after problem that I had to look up fixes for in order to be able to install and launch the .apk file. But in the end I got it, and boy was I glad when it was finally done!

This was pretty challenging for an easy rated box and it took awhile and a lot of google searching to figure out how to do some things that were new to me like using curl to interact with an API, forge JWT tokens, create and interact with core dumps to pull information out of memory, and more.

Again, no walkthrough since this box is not officially retired.

## *Paper* on Hack the Box
#### February 7th 2022

Topics: ![](images/linux.png) ![](images/web.png) ![](images/wordpress.png) ![](images/lfi.png)

This is my first actual HTB machine other than the starting point so it was a lot of fun comparing how things are on HTB vs how they are on THM. HTB definitely holds your hand less so the difficulty I'd say is a bit higher than comparably rated machines on THM.

I also went through this with somebody from my **Evolve** bootcamp and when you see the term **I** you can take it as **we** since we both spent several hours in Discord banging our heads against a wall figuring out each piece of the puzzle. Despite that we loved every second of it!

I won't post the actual walkthrough yet since this box is only 2 days old and it's against the HTB terms of service, but here's a completion screenshot:

## Week 1 of the Evolve Bootcamp Complete
#### February 4th 2022

Topics: ![](images/learning.png)

I couldn't be happier with how well the first week went. The lead instructor, Michael Creaney, is not only extremely knowledgeable but is good at teaching as well. Sometimes you get one or the other, but not this time thankfully.

The assistant instructors are also very good and seem like they truly care. They're all Evolve alumni so they've been through the bootcamp and can help out with any general questions we have in addition to providing insight on what we're learning.

So far so good!

## Today is the day my Evolve Security Bootcamp Starts!
#### January 31st 2022

Topics: ![](images/learning.png)

About 3 months ago I finished some local college courses in their Cybersecurity learning path, and it turned out that the next step in the path wasn't available in the spring semester and I'd have to wait many months until the summer semester to be able to continue on. That was too long to wait so I decided to look around for other learning opportunities.

There were several choices but I eventually ended up seriously looking at the bootcamp that **Evolve Security** offered. It had great reviews, they seemed to be well respected in the industry, and many other features such as help with job placement, a voucher for the Security+ certification at the end of the bootcamp, and other bonuses.

It was a definitely a bit pricey, but in the end I believed it would be well worth the cost given everything I found during my research. So I took the plunge and officially signed up.

Today, it finally starts! It's going to be a lot of work with classes meeting 4 days a week and every other Saturday, which equates to roughly 20-30 hours of work per week split between in class work, out of class studying, and hands on labs.

I'm excited and can't wait to get started!

## *Hello World*
#### January 31st 2022

Hello everyone who may have stumbled across this site and thank you for visiting. I'm creating this primarily as a place to post walkthroughs for CTF challenges I complete as a way to:

- Reinforce my learning
- Get in the habit of documenting everything
- And give back the community / help those who are learning as well

I'll try and publish new walkthroughs at least once a week but will often add more than that.

I'm currently learning with the eventual goal of career switching into Cybersecurity so I'll also sometimes add accomplishments or other Cybersecurity related items to this blog as well.

If you have questions, comments, or would like to set something like this up yourself and need a little help there please feel free to get in touch with me on Twitter - [**@jdotinfo**]

Again, thanks for visiting and I hope you find this resource useful!
